## Phaser 3 Documentation (archived 2026-02-18)

All Phaser-era docs were moved here when the project pivoted to Godot 4:

- [phaser/architecture.md](phaser/architecture.md) — Phaser 3 + PyWebView system architecture
- [phaser/project-context.md](phaser/project-context.md) — Phaser product identity and runtime model
- [phaser/build-and-release.md](phaser/build-and-release.md) — PyInstaller build pipeline
- [phaser/module-ownership.md](phaser/module-ownership.md) — JS code ownership map
- [phaser/troubleshooting.md](phaser/troubleshooting.md) — Phaser triage playbook
- [phaser/release-checklist.md](phaser/release-checklist.md) — Phaser release gates
- [phaser/design-decisions.md](phaser/design-decisions.md) — Phaser ADRs
- [phaser/known-failure-patterns.md](phaser/known-failure-patterns.md) — Phaser failure patterns

- [phaser/resolved-issues.md](phaser/resolved-issues.md) — Phaser resolved issues (OI-001 through OI-008)

These files should not be modified. They exist as historical reference for the Phaser build era.
