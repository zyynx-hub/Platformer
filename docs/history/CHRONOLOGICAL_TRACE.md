## Change Ledger
- L3 | `change` | files: - | This file is the raw transcript placeholder created from the current session context.
- L13 | `change` | files: - | Build Phaser side-scroller demo
- L17 | `change` | files: - | You are Codex, acting as a senior game-dev engineer. Build a complete, runnable 2D side-scrolling platformer.
- L20 | `change` | files: - | - Use Phaser 3 (HTML5 + JavaScript). Provide code that runs locally with no build tools.
- L46 | `change` | files: - | - Simple beep sounds generated in code (WebAudio) for jump, coin, damage.
- L64 | `change` | files: main.js | I’ve created the HTML shell and I’m now writing main.js with the full gameplay systems: coyote/buffer jump logic, checkpoint respawn, enemy stomp damage rules, camera follow, and UI scene state handling.
- L66 | `change` | files: - | Core files are now in place and the game logic is implemented end-to-end. I couldn’t run an automated JS syntax check because node is not installed in this environment, so I’m providing the full source directly for you to run in browser.
- L68 | `change` | files: - | Files I created:
- L77 | `change` | files: - | Explains that placeholder visuals/audio are generated in code and that external assets are optional.
- L792 | `change` | files: - | This project intentionally uses generated placeholder graphics and does not require external art or audio files.
- L794 | `change` | files: main.js | All textures are created at runtime in `main.js` (BootScene) using Phaser Graphics.
- L815 | `change` | files: main.js | Double jump is now added in main.js.
- L819 | `change` | files: - | Added PLAYER.maxJumps = 2.
- L820 | `change` | files: - | Added this.jumpsUsed player state.
- L823 | `change` | files: - | Added airborne jump when jumpPressed and jumpsUsed < maxJumps.
- L830 | `change` | files: - | I’m adding a level-complete win condition at 10 coins and wiring a cinematic victory sequence. I’ll update GameScene for the completion trigger and UIScene for a stylized “anime finish” overlay and restart flow.
- L832 | `change` | files: - | I’ve wired the victory flow; I’m making one final polish pass so the objective is always explicit in UI text (Coins: current/10) and on the start screen.
- L834 | `change` | files: main.js | Implemented in main.js:
- L836 | `change` | files: - | Added a clear win goal: level completes when 10 coins are collected (WIN_COIN_TARGET).
- L837 | `change` | files: main.js | Updated HUD to show progress as Coins: current/10 in main.js.
- L838 | `change` | files: main.js | Updated start screen text to explicitly state the objective in main.js.
- L839 | `change` | files: main.js | Added level-complete state and trigger in collectCoin() with completeLevel() in main.js.
- L840 | `change` | files: - | Added anime-style victory sequence in UIScene:
- L846 | `change` | files: - | Added ENTER handling to return to menu after victory.
- L864 | `change` | files: - | Added. The victory overlay now includes a stylized, fully clothed anime-inspired character drawn with Phaser shapes (no external assets), plus entrance/bounce animation during level clear.
- L866 | `change` | files: main.js | Updated in main.js:
- L870 | `change` | files: - | Character is created in createVictoryFX()
- L880 | `change` | files: main.js | Added demo shortcut in main.js:
- L883 | `change` | files: - | Implemented as a JustDown key check, so it triggers once per key press.
- L897 | `change` | files: - | Added asset loading in BootScene.preload():
- L910 | `change` | files: main.js | That screenshot is the Phaser missing-texture pattern. I fixed it in main.js by changing how the GIF is loaded:
- L913 | `change` | files: - | Added direct browser-image loading in BootScene.loadVictoryGirlTexture() using new Image() + this.textures.addImage(...).
- L915 | `change` | files: - | Added a safe fallback in UIScene.buildVictoryCharacter() if the GIF still fails.
- L929 | `change` | files: - | Fixed. The freeze was caused by Boot scene waiting on the GIF load callback before starting the game.
- L949 | `change` | files: kawaii-anime-girl.gif | I see the problem: the victory panel is created before the GIF texture is ready, so it stays on the text fallback. I’m changing it to build/rebuild the character panel at the moment victory starts, so it uses the actual kawaii-anime-girl.gif if available.
- L955 | `change` | files: kawaii-anime-girl.gif, main.js | Updated main.js so the actual kawaii-anime-girl.gif is used at victory time instead of getting stuck on the fallback.
- L982 | `change` | files: - | Removed texture-based GIF loading logic from BootScene.
- L1003 | `change` | files: main.js | Implemented in main.js:
- L1005 | `change` | files: - | Replaced square player with a stylized anime girl sprite generated in code.
- L1006 | `change` | files: - | Added real animation states:
- L1011 | `change` | files: - | Added a Tokyo-style background scene in gameplay:
- L1029 | `change` | files: main.js | I’ll refactor the monolithic main.js into small modules (config, systems, scenes, level data) while keeping it runnable without build tools. I’m first mapping the current file and then I’ll split it into readable files with ES module imports.
- L1031 | `change` | files: AGENTS.md | No skill from the listed AGENTS.md set applies to this refactor, so I’m proceeding with a direct modular code split. I’m now creating a js/ structure and moving each scene/system into its own file while preserving behavior.
- L1037 | `change` | files: index.html, main.js | I’ve finished the modular split and updated index.html to load the new file layout. I’m now adding a compatibility main.js wrapper (instead of deleting) so the repo remains understandable and backward-friendly.
- L1039 | `change` | files: index.html | Refactor complete. The monolith is now split into focused modules and index.html loads them in order.
- L1051 | `change` | files: main.js | Added bootstrap entrypoint main.js (creates Phaser config/game)
- L1052 | `change` | files: index.html | Updated script loading in index.html
- L1075 | `change` | files: - | Updated to true fullscreen viewport rendering.
- L1080 | `change` | files: - | Switched Phaser to Phaser.Scale.RESIZE
- L1084 | `change` | files: - | Removed centered layout/padding constraints
- L1095 | `change` | files: - | Implemented. You were right on all points.
- L1100 | `change` | files: - | Added tile-aware patrol logic so enemies turn around when:
- L1104 | `change` | files: - | Helper functions added:
- L1109 | `change` | files: - | Added persistent tutorial text in HUD area explaining:
- L1112 | `change` | files: ui-scene.js | Added in ui-scene.js (line 69)
- L1114 | `change` | files: - | Updated menu intro with legend:
- L1118 | `change` | files: menu-scene.js | Updated in menu-scene.js (line 22)
- L1119 | `change` | files: game-scene.js | Also added world guide labels near spawn in game-scene.js (line 143)
- L1131 | `change` | files: - | I’ll replace the current in-world labels with a proper pre-game tutorial overlay in the menu: transparent panel, multi-step “Next” flow, then “Start Game” on the last step. I’ll also remove the in-level tutorial text so gameplay starts clean.
- L1145 | `change` | files: - | Removed world text labels from gameplay
- L1146 | `change` | files: - | Removed temporary HUD tutorial text so the level starts clean
- L1147 | `change` | files: - | Updated files:
- L1150 | `change` | files: game-scene.js | game-scene.js (removed in-world label overlay)
- L1151 | `change` | files: ui-scene.js | ui-scene.js (removed startup legend text)
- L1214 | `change` | files: - | Core options are wired; now I’m connecting them to boot/runtime config (fps cap, pixel-perfect, resolution scale, fullscreen) and adding the new OptionsScene to scene registration and script loading.
- L1216 | `change` | files: - | Implemented. The menu is now a real start screen with Play/Continue/Options/Credits/Exit, and a full options system is in place.
- L1223 | `change` | files: - | Added OPTIONS, CREDITS, EXIT
- L1233 | `change` | files: settings.js | Added persistent settings storage in settings.js
- L1235 | `change` | files: - | Wired options into runtime behavior:
- L1244 | `change` | files: - | Files added
- L1248 | `change` | files: - | Files updated
- L1275 | `change` | files: - | What’s implemented:
- L1286 | `change` | files: options-scene.js | Added a prominent red < BACK button in options-scene.js (top-left).
- L1299 | `change` | files: game-scene.js | Fixed enemy edge-turn behavior in game-scene.js.
- L1303 | `change` | files: - | Added turnCooldownUntil per enemy to prevent rapid flip-flopping at edges.
- L1308 | `change` | files: - | Updated patrol call to pass current time into updateEnemyPatrol(enemy, now).
- L1315 | `change` | files: - | Understood. I’ll switch enemy patrol from “probe and guess” to fixed patrol bounds computed from the platform tiles under each enemy. That removes the left-edge ambiguity and forces a reliable turn-back.
- L1317 | `change` | files: - | Patched with a stronger fix for left-edge stall.
- L1323 | `change` | files: - | Patrol update now primarily uses those bounds:
- L1327 | `change` | files: - | Kept hazard-ahead turning, removed no-ground flip logic that was causing ambiguous behavior.
- L1336 | `change` | files: - | Patrol logic updated to fix both cases you showed:
- L1338 | `change` | files: - | Left enemy stuck: fixed by falling back to dynamic edge sensing when computed patrol span is too short.
- L1339 | `change` | files: - | Right enemy jitter/bug: fixed by cleaner boundary checks (else if), no hard clamp lock, and guarded turn cooldown.
- L1346 | `change` | files: - | Added airborne fallback turn check for dynamic mode to avoid getting stranded.
- L1352 | `change` | files: - | Got it. I’m removing the patrol throttling and updating enemy direction every frame, plus handling wall contact with touching flags and a tiny push-off so they can’t freeze against a wall.
- L1356 | `change` | files: - | Enemy patrol now updates every frame (removed 70ms throttle).
- L1362 | `change` | files: - | tiny push-off (x += 1.5 / x -= 1.5) to prevent sticking.
- L1375 | `change` | files: game-scene.js | Added a visible health bar above the player in game-scene.js.
- L1393 | `change` | files: - | Called during scene setup, damage handling, respawn, and per-frame update.
- L1401 | `change` | files: - | I’ve wired the new intro scene; doing a quick verification pass to confirm it’s referenced in both script load and Phaser scene list.
- L1403 | `change` | files: - | You’re right. I added the intro back so Play now opens a proper pre-game preview/tutorial before gameplay.
- L1415 | `change` | files: index.html | Added to index.html script includes
- L1416 | `change` | files: main.js | Added to scene list in main.js
- L1424 | `change` | files: - | Fixed. R on game over now restarts the level directly instead of returning to main menu.
- L1439 | `change` | files: - | Fixed restart freeze.
- L1446 | `change` | files: - | Added cleanup in GameScene.shutdown() to remove the event listener and avoid duplicate handlers.
- L1465 | `change` | files: - | I fixed this:
- L1494 | `root-cause` | files: - | I found the root cause: fullscreen RESIZE is stretching the camera viewport, so your level design spacing breaks on large monitors. I’m switching to a fixed gameplay framing (camera zoom based on target 960x540) so fullscreen stays full-screen but the level keeps intended proportions.
- L1496 | `change` | files: - | Fixed layout spacing issue on fullscreen.
- L1501 | `change` | files: - | Added updateCameraFraming():
- L1505 | `change` | files: - | Removed previous global scale-zoom usage inside gameplay
- L1507 | `change` | files: - | Removed this.scale.setZoom(...) from options runtime apply
- L1534 | `change` | files: - | Added createHazardTexture(...) with visible spike triangles.
- L1536 | `change` | files: - | Added createEnemyTexture(...) with eyes, horns, and fangs to read as dangerous.
- L1548 | `change` | files: - | Fixed spike placement.
- L1555 | `change` | files: - | Moved hazards to supported ground columns:
- L1561 | `change` | files: - | Hard refresh to load the updated level data.
- L1570 | `change` | files: - | Done. That track is now wired as menu music.
- L1575 | `change` | files: - | Added preload:
- L1578 | `change` | files: - | Added looped menu BGM playback (setupMenuMusic())
- L1580 | `change` | files: - | Added safe user-input retry for browser audio lock
- L1592 | `change` | files: - | Fixed the boot blocker.
- L1600 | `change` | files: - | Removed audio preload from Boot (so Boot never blocks on music).
- L1603 | `change` | files: - | Added safe guards:
- L1616 | `change` | files: - | Added a fallback so menu music can still play if Phaser audio loading fails.
- L1620 | `change` | files: - | Added HTML audio fallback:
- L1640 | `change` | files: - | Fixed the overlapping menu music issue.
- L1644 | `change` | files: - | Added scene lifecycle cleanup hooks:
- L1648 | `change` | files: - | Added hard single-instance cleanup in setupMenuMusic():
- L1659 | `intent` | files: - | Understood. I’ll keep menu music persistent across Menu <-> Options transitions: no stop on options open, and no forced restart when menu scene is recreated. I’m patching the music lifecycle now.
- L1665 | `change` | files: - | Removed automatic music stop on scene shutdown/destroy.
- L1666 | `change` | files: - | Removed stopMenuMusic() when opening Options.
- L1667 | `change` | files: - | Removed hard cleanup/restart behavior from setupMenuMusic().
- L1668 | `change` | files: - | Reuse existing active audio (Phaser or HTML fallback) and only update volume.
- L1695 | `intent` | files: - | Got it. I’m making gameplay music playback robust like the menu: lazy-load if needed, retry on user input (autoplay-safe), and HTML-audio fallback if Phaser audio fails. I’ll patch GameScene plus menu cleanup for game-audio fallback.
- L1697 | `change` | files: - | Patched. Gameplay music now has the same reliability handling as menu music.
- L1707 | `change` | files: - | Added setupHtmlGameMusicFallback(...) for robust fallback path.
- L1716 | `change` | files: - | I’ll persist a “preview seen” flag in settings and update Play flow: first time shows intro, later runs skip directly to game. I’m patching settings, menu, and intro scenes now.
- L1718 | `change` | files: - | Implemented.
- L1727 | `change` | files: settings.js | Added persistent flag in settings.js:
- L1740 | `intent` | files: - | Understood. I’ll make the preview-skip flag session-only: it will persist while you stay in the game, but reset on full browser refresh. I’m patching settings persistence so introSeen is never saved to localStorage.
- L1768 | `change` | files: - | Implemented.
- L1780 | `change` | files: - | Added pause-audio state and methods:
- L1795 | `change` | files: - | I’ll update the pause-music file path to your new filename in both Phaser preload and the HTML fallback path so pause audio works with the replaced file.
- L1797 | `change` | files: - | Updated to the new filename everywhere pause music is loaded:
- L1802 | `change` | files: - | HTML fallback path updated to same file
- L1812 | `change` | files: - | Fixed. Pause music now stops when returning to main menu and won’t overlap the menu track.
- L1829 | `change` | files: - | Updated: gameplay music now starts immediately when the player clicks Play.
- L1833 | `change` | files: - | Added startGameplayMusicNow().
- L1841 | `intent` | files: - | Got it. I’ll explicitly start the gameplay track inside IntroScene itself (level preview scene), so it always begins during preview, not only after entering GameScene. I’m patching that now.
- L1843 | `change` | files: - | Fixed. Gameplay music now starts in the level preview (IntroScene) itself.
- L1848 | `change` | files: - | Added ensureGameplayMusicForPreview()
- L1859 | `change` | files: - | Thanks, that means the Play click is still not being used as the actual audio-unlock moment for game-bgm. I’m going to move “start game music” directly into the Play button handler path and remove any conflicting stop/restart calls that can cancel it during scene transition.
- L1861 | `root-cause` | files: - | I found the likely cause: on Play, startGameplayMusicNow() only tried immediate Phaser sound.add/play and returned on failure, so it could miss the first click window. I’m making it robust with lazy load + input retry + HTML fallback directly in that path.
- L1863 | `change` | files: - | Patched. Gameplay music start on Play is now robust.
- L1871 | `change` | files: - | Added startGameplayMusicHtmlFallback(...) for that fallback path.
- L1905 | `change` | files: - | Core pressure mechanics are implemented; I’m adding a quick tutorial text tweak so players understand timer/projectile pressure immediately instead of feeling blindsided.
- L1909 | `change` | files: - | Implemented. The game now has real pressure mechanics:
- L1912 | `change` | files: - | Added countdown timer per difficulty:
- L1931 | `change` | files: - | Also updated preview text so players are informed:
- L1936 | `change` | files: - | Files updated:
- L1941 | `change` | files: intro-scene.js | intro-scene.js (updated tutorial wording)
- L1945 | `change` | files: - | Projectiles of enemies shoudn't break blocks, and make the spikes into a laser type weapon so it's obvious where the shots are coming from, remove the "taken damage" from the spikes, only let the balls do damage, also add more laser weapons in the map, not too much, else it wouldn't be playerable
- L1951 | `change` | files: - | Implemented.
- L1957 | `change` | files: boot-scene.js | Updated in boot-scene.js (createHazardTexture).
- L1962 | `change` | files: - | Added a few extra laser weapons (balanced, not spammy).
- L1964 | `change` | files: level-data.js | Added turret tiles in level-data.js at:
- L1969 | `change` | files: - | Updated intro text to match new behavior.
- L1982 | `change` | files: - | Fixed both issues.
- L1990 | `change` | files: - | Updated colliders to destroy the projectile only:
- L1996 | `change` | files: - | Added per-turret cooldown (nextShotAt) with staggered start timing.
- L1997 | `change` | files: - | Turret firing behavior updated
- L2004 | `change` | files: - | When first load of the game, music doesn't start playing when "play", only when going ingame, returning back to menu from pause menu and clicking "play", again the music starts playing. Remove the feature that plays in the level guide section of the game, just let the music play only in the main game
- L2006 | `change` | files: - | Understood. I’ll remove all “play music in level preview” behavior and keep gameplay music starting only in GameScene. I’m patching MenuScene and IntroScene now.
- L2008 | `change` | files: - | I’ve removed preview music hooks; now only GameScene controls gameplay BGM. I’m doing a quick grep to ensure there are no leftover preview-start calls.
- L2010 | `change` | files: - | Done. I removed the “play during level guide/preview” behavior.
- L2020 | `change` | files: - | Removed early gameplay-music start calls from Play flow.
- L2021 | `change` | files: - | Removed preview/gameplay prestart helper methods.
- L2023 | `change` | files: - | Removed ensureGameplayMusicForPreview() and its call.
- L2031 | `change` | files: - | Patched likely crash cause: stale active scenes when starting a new run.
- L2052 | `root-cause` | files: - | I found a likely root cause: UIScene re-registers keyboard/game-event listeners every run and never removes them, so after returning to menu and replaying, handlers stack and can crash the game flow. I’m patching proper listener cleanup now.
- L2054 | `root-cause` | files: - | Fixed likely crash root cause.
- L2058 | `change` | files: - | UIScene added keyboard/game-event listeners every time it was launched.
- L2059 | `change` | files: - | Those listeners were not removed on scene shutdown.
- L2068 | `change` | files: - | Added full cleanup in shutdown():
- L2080 | `change` | files: index.html, main.js | Debug module is created. I’m wiring it into index.html and wrapping all scenes in main.js so runtime exceptions are captured to the on-screen console with copyable blocks.
- L2084 | `change` | files: - | Done. I added a real in-game debug console so you can capture exactly what breaks.
- L2095 | `change` | files: - | preload/init/create/update/shutdown are wrapped in try/catch
- L2105 | `change` | files: - | Files added/updated:
- L2107 | `change` | files: debug.js | Added: debug.js
- L2108 | `change` | files: index.html | Updated: index.html (includes debug module)
- L2109 | `change` | files: main.js | Updated: main.js (initializes debug + wraps scenes)
- L2127 | `change` | files: - | Great, that confirms we’re hitting the classic masked browser error (Script error.) with no stack. I’ll unmask it by enabling cross-origin stack capture for Phaser CDN and improve the debug handler to log filename/line/column/script-tag load failures. Then you can send a useful trace.
- L2134 | `change` | files: index.html | Updated index.html:
- L2137 | `change` | files: debug.js | Updated debug.js:
- L2139 | `change` | files: - | Captures resource load failures (script/audio/image) with tag + source URL.
- L2169 | `root-cause` | files: - | Perfect trace. Root cause is clear: UIScene.updateHud() is still being triggered during scene teardown, and setText() runs on a text object whose underlying canvas has already been disposed. I’m adding a defensive HUD-update guard + safe listener lifecycle to prevent this crash path.
- L2173 | `change` | files: - | Great report. I fixed the exact crash source from your trace.
- L2175 | `root-cause` | files: - | Root cause:
- L2181 | `change` | files: - | Added strong guards at start of updateHud():
- L2200 | `change` | files: level-data.js | I removed 3 hazard turret placements from level-data.js:
- L2202 | `change` | files: - | removed rows[16][27]
- L2203 | `change` | files: - | removed rows[12][45]
- L2204 | `change` | files: - | removed rows[11][66]
- L2222 | `change` | files: - | Now I’ll wire per-level enemy types in GameScene with unique behavior: walker, hopper, dasher, and tank. I’m patching enemy spawn, AI update, and stomp/damage handling.
- L2234 | `change` | files: - | I found the project files; next I’m checking level-data, game-scene, and boot-scene to confirm all 4 levels and unique enemy behaviors are wired without missing references.
- L2240 | `change` | files: - | Implemented. The 4-level system with unique enemy types is now wired correctly.
- L2242 | `change` | files: - | What I fixed
- L2271 | `change` | files: - | Implemented both requests.
- L2275 | `change` | files: level-data.js | Rebuilt level-data.js so each level has a distinct layout pattern:
- L2286 | `change` | files: game-scene.js | Updated game-scene.js:
- L2287 | `change` | files: - | added normalizeTurretTiles()
- L2290 | `change` | files: - | Files updated
- L2304 | `change` | files: - | Agreed. I fixed this with both authored layout changes and runtime spawn sanitation.
- L2308 | `change` | files: - | Moved clustered turret spots away from enemy lanes (especially level 4).
- L2316 | `change` | files: - | Added enemy spawn normalization
- L2353 | `intent` | files: - | Understood. I’m switching turret placement to a stricter authored model: better hand-tuned turret coordinates per level, and normalization will no longer shove turrets deep into irrelevant fallback spots.
- L2355 | `change` | files: - | I’ve updated all turret coordinates to elevated, lane-overlooking positions. Next I’ll tighten normalization so invalid turrets are dropped instead of being relocated into useless zones.
- L2357 | `change` | files: - | I removed the “drop anywhere in column” fallback, which was the main cause of weird turret positions. I’ll quickly sanity-check the modified turret sets and normalization references.
- L2359 | `change` | files: - | Fixed. The turret system was still over-correcting into bad positions.
- L2385 | `change` | files: - | Implemented. Enemies now try to escape when stuck in cracks.
- L2388 | `change` | files: game-scene.js | Updated game-scene.js in updateEnemyPatrol(...):
- L2393 | `change` | files: - | Added per-enemy initialization for lastX / stuckSince at spawn.
- L2402 | `change` | files: game-scene.js | Stuck-recovery logic inside patrol update: game-scene.js (line 813)
- L2410 | `change` | files: - | Also refactor the levels so every level has a differnet file
- L2412 | `change` | files: - | I’ll verify current state first (the level-data file may be partially changed from the interrupted turn), then refactor level definitions into separate files and wire a loader so each level is isolated.
- L2414 | `change` | files: index.html, level-1.js, level-4.js, level-data.js | The interrupted turn deleted level-data.js, so I’m restoring it with a cleaner architecture: level-1.js … level-4.js plus a shared level-data.js loader. I’ll also update index.html script order.
- L2416 | `change` | files: index.html, level-data.js | I’ve split the four levels into separate files. Now I’ll restore level-data.js as a shared dispatcher and update index.html to load all level files correctly.
- L2418 | `change` | files: - | Refactor is complete. I’m doing a final quick consistency check so the new per-level files are actually loaded and callable by createLevelData.
- L2423 | `change` | files: - | Added per-level files:
- L2429 | `change` | files: - | Restored shared dispatcher:
- L2433 | `change` | files: - | Updated script loading order:
- L2449 | `change` | files: - | Fixed with a different method.
- L2455 | `change` | files: - | Added canStandAt(x,y) (open tile + support + headroom + no hazard)
- L2456 | `change` | files: - | Added patrolSpanAt(x,y) (measures contiguous walkable width)
- L2457 | `change` | files: - | Added hasPatrolRoom(x,y) with minimum span (>= 6 tiles)
- L2467 | `change` | files: - | Best way for this codebase (Phaser + no build tools):
- L2517 | `change` | files: - | Perfect, I wired your animated spikes.
- L2543 | `intent` | files: IFFY_IDLE.png | Understood. I’ll revert turrets back to the original static hazard and move IFFY_IDLE.png usage to the player only (idle animation), with fallback to your current player textures.
- L2545 | `change` | files: - | I reverted the asset mapping in BootScene. Next I’m patching GameScene so turrets always use static hazard and the player uses your IFFY_IDLE animation while idle.
- L2551 | `change` | files: - | Done. I switched it exactly as requested.
- L2556 | `change` | files: - | Updated files
- L2582 | `change` | files: - | Remove or ignore:
- L2594 | `change` | files: - | Found and fixed.
- L2596 | `root-cause` | files: - | Root cause: idle animation only played when the player texture was already player-idle-sheet. After first jump/fall state, it switched to legacy textures and never came back.
- L2611 | `change` | files: - | I’ll quickly check how your debug overlay is wired, then I’ll explain exactly why this kind of issue can fail silently without errors.
- L2619 | `change` | files: - | I added explicit debug warnings/logs so this is visible now:
- L2635 | `root-cause` | files: - | Great, this confirms the root cause: Phaser fails to load the file itself, so animation never gets created. I’ll add a robust loader (multiple filename fallbacks + load-error logging) and validate the image file signature.
- L2676 | `root-cause` | files: - | Great log, and root cause is confirmed:
- L2681 | `change` | files: - | I patched this now:
- L2711 | `change` | files: - | player-idle-sheet is created
- L2725 | `change` | files: - | Fixed both.
- L2729 | `change` | files: - | Added useImportedCharacter flag.
- L2737 | `change` | files: - | uses a fixed imported frame while airborne
- L2754 | `change` | files: - | Removed manual offset that was causing visual drift.
- L2779 | `change` | files: - | Updated:
- L2782 | `change` | files: - | Added drawCreatureEnemy(...)
- L2795 | `change` | files: - | Electron wrapper is added. I’m now patching the menu EXIT action to use the desktop bridge and keep browser fallback messaging.
- L2797 | `change` | files: - | Implemented.
- L2800 | `change` | files: - | Added Electron desktop wrapper:
- L2805 | `change` | files: - | Wired EXIT button to actually close app in desktop mode:
- L2817 | `change` | files: - | Build a Windows executable
- L2824 | `intent` | files: - | Understood. I’ll make this truly shareable by generating a standalone portable .exe now, so your friend can run it without installing Node/npm or any setup.
- L2826 | `change` | files: - | Build blocker found: this machine has no Node/npm installed, so Electron packaging can’t be produced here right now. I’ll switch to a no-Node packaging path (Python WebView + PyInstaller) so you still get a sendable .exe.
- L2828 | `change` | files: - | I’ve wired EXIT to also work under a Python desktop runtime. Next I’ll add a native launcher and build script that outputs a standalone .exe you can send directly.
- L2839 | `change` | files: - | Built a portable desktop build at:
- L2853 | `change` | files: - | Added desktop wrapper + build path:
- L2856 | `change` | files: - | Wired exit bridge:
- L2862 | `change` | files: - | This isn't the last build, this will be my new way of testing each new version, so no more internet, delete all internet related file
- L2864 | `change` | files: - | Understood. I’ll remove all web/internet dependency paths from the source and keep the project strictly offline-first for your desktop testing flow. I’m scanning for any remaining http/https usage and deleting unneeded internet-related wrapper files.
- L2866 | `change` | files: - | I’ll clean it to offline-only now: remove Electron/npm files entirely, remove online install steps from the build script, and keep only the local Python desktop path with local Phaser/assets.
- L2868 | `change` | files: - | I’ve removed the internet/npm/Electron files. I’ll do a final scan for remaining external URL dependencies in your source tree and confirm offline status.
- L2870 | `change` | files: - | I removed the Electron/npm files. I’m doing one more cleanup pass to remove leftover Electron hooks/messages so the codebase is purely local desktop runtime.
- L2872 | `change` | files: - | Done. I removed internet-related packaging files and left the project offline-first.
- L2886 | `change` | files: - | Removed internet/server recommendation text in runtime log:
- L2905 | `change` | files: - | Build script updated. I’m generating the new one-file EXE in the top folder now and then I’ll confirm its exact path.
- L2907 | `change` | files: - | Build complete as single-file top-level EXE. I’ll quickly verify the exact executable file now.
- L2911 | `change` | files: - | Single file executable created at top level:
- L2919 | `change` | files: build_portable_exe.bat | I also updated build_portable_exe.bat to always build this way (--onefile + output in root).
- L2922 | `change` | files: - | Make a handy button ingame that loads new updates and show if new update is available
- L2926 | `change` | files: - | Here. I can add that update button next.
- L2930 | `change` | files: - | In-game Update button (Menu + Pause).
- L2932 | `change` | files: - | Shows: Up to date / New update available.
- L2933 | `change` | files: - | If update exists: opens your download URL or runs a local updater EXE.
- L2941 | `change` | files: - | I’m implementing option 2 now: an in-game Update button with an optional online check toggle. I’ll wire settings + UI + manifest check + desktop URL open.
- L2943 | `change` | files: - | I’ve mapped the changes. Next I’m adding a small Updater core module, hooking it into desktop API + settings/options, and placing an Update button in UIScene with status + download action.
- L2945 | `change` | files: index.html | I found a critical state issue: your source files (index.html, js/, assets/) are no longer in the workspace root, only build artifacts remain. I need to locate/restore the source tree first before I can add the update button safely.
- L2947 | `change` | files: - | Core changes are in. I’m rebuilding the top-level single-file EXE now so this update-check button is included in the executable you distribute.
- L2949 | `change` | files: - | Implemented option 2.
- L2951 | `change` | files: - | What’s added
- L2952 | `change` | files: - | In-game Update button (top-right HUD) in UIScene:
- L2955 | `change` | files: - | If update found: button switches to Download
- L2959 | `change` | files: - | Online update check on/off
- L2966 | `change` | files: - | Version compare + update check logic
- L2970 | `change` | files: - | Added:
- L2973 | `change` | files: - | Settings schema updated:
- L2976 | `change` | files: index.html, updater.js | index.html restored/updated and includes updater.js
- L2978 | `change` | files: - | EXE rebuilt
- L2979 | `change` | files: - | Your latest single-file EXE is rebuilt at:
- L2989 | `change` | files: - | If version > Current version, game shows update available.
- L2992 | `change` | files: - | Update only be in main menu
- L2994 | `change` | files: - | I’ll move the update UI out of in-game HUD and put it only in the main menu, reusing the same updater logic and settings.
- L2996 | `change` | files: - | I’m removing the update widget from UIScene and adding it to MenuScene only, then rebuilding the EXE so your latest binary matches that behavior.
- L2998 | `change` | files: - | Menu-only update UI is patched. I’m rebuilding your top-level single EXE again so this change is included immediately.
- L3000 | `change` | files: - | Done. Update controls are now main menu only.
- L3003 | `change` | files: - | Removed update widget from in-game HUD:
- L3005 | `change` | files: - | Added update widget to main menu:
- L3008 | `change` | files: - | Update -> checks updates
- L3010 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt EXE
- L3011 | `change` | files: - | Latest single-file build:
- L3023 | `change` | files: - | Fixed. Fullscreen now auto-adjusts.
- L3027 | `change` | files: - | Added robust size sync for desktop/webview fullscreen:
- L3031 | `change` | files: - | EXE rebuilt
- L3032 | `change` | files: - | Updated binary is ready at:
- L3045 | `change` | files: - | Fixed it properly for the EXE runtime.
- L3047 | `root-cause` | files: - | Root cause: fullscreen in your desktop app must be controlled by pywebview window API, not browser fullscreen API.
- L3051 | `change` | files: - | added native API: set_fullscreen(enabled) using toggle_fullscreen()
- L3056 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt EXE
- L3057 | `change` | files: - | Use this updated build:
- L3064 | `change` | files: - | This is how it looks and doesn't display in console, refactor the entire game so everything is prompted into the console, every possible warning, every possible not wanted outcome
- L3070 | `change` | files: main.js | Telemetry hooks are added. Next I’m wiring them in main.js and replacing resize polling with pywebview native size checks so fullscreen size changes are captured even when JS events fail.
- L3082 | `change` | files: - | I found why you “don’t see console”: the current EXE is likely built windowed (--noconsole). I’m checking the build script/spec next and will switch to a real terminal-enabled debug build while also improving in-game structured warnings.
- L3086 | `change` | files: - | Next I’m enabling a true terminal-backed debug build (so logs print live outside the game window) and keeping the EXE in the root as requested.
- L3094 | `change` | files: - | Implemented. I refactored diagnostics so runtime behavior is now aggressively logged to both:
- L3106 | `change` | files: - | Added log_event(level, source, message) bridge.
- L3107 | `change` | files: - | Added host logger writing to terminal and runtime-debug.log.
- L3108 | `change` | files: - | Added fatal launcher crash logging with traceback.
- L3111 | `change` | files: - | Added runtime diagnostics loop for “non-crash bad outcomes”:
- L3118 | `change` | files: - | Added restart event warning trace.
- L3121 | `change` | files: - | Added structured logs for major user actions and state transitions (Play, Options open/save/back, pause/menu transitions, game over, etc.).
- L3122 | `change` | files: - | Build switched to console-enabled EXE:
- L3124 | `change` | files: build_portable_exe.bat | build_portable_exe.bat removed --windowed
- L3126 | `change` | files: - | Build completed
- L3133 | `change` | files: - | Where can I see if game has an update?
- L3135 | `change` | files: - | In the Main Menu, top-right: click the Update button.
- L3137 | `change` | files: - | If update checks are enabled in Options, it will show:
- L3140 | `change` | files: - | Click Download to open the update URL.
- L3143 | `change` | files: - | Online update check = On
- L3149 | `change` | files: - | I’ll add a persistent bottom-left version/status label in the main menu that shows current version and live update state (Up to date / Update available / errors), then wire it to the existing update check flow.
- L3151 | `change` | files: - | I’m adding a bottom-left info badge in the main menu with Version and Update status, and I’ll make it auto-check on menu load (when enabled) so it can immediately show Up to date.
- L3153 | `change` | files: - | I’ve wired the UI change in code. I’ll rebuild the EXE so the bottom-left version/update status is immediately available in your desktop build.
- L3155 | `change` | files: - | Done. Added bottom-left update/version display in the main menu.
- L3161 | `change` | files: - | Update: <status>
- L3162 | `change` | files: - | It auto-checks on menu load (if update checks are enabled) and will show:
- L3166 | `change` | files: - | Also rebuilt the EXE, so this is live in:
- L3184 | `change` | files: - | Build difficulty curves per level (safe intro -> pressure -> climax -> relief).
- L3197 | `change` | files: - | Remove friction bugs (spawn oddities, edge stalls, unclear damage moments).
- L3204 | `change` | files: - | I’ll implement a focused v2 quality pass now: tighter movement/hit feedback, clearer enemy behavior states, and stronger level progression rewards so the game feels purposeful instead of just jumping. I’m starting by scanning the gameplay config and scene hooks to patch this end-to-end without breaking your current build.
- L3210 | `change` | files: - | I’ve added the new feel/progression systems in code. I’m doing a quick integrity pass now to catch syntax or flow regressions before I rebuild the EXE.
- L3212 | `change` | files: - | I also updated the tutorial preview so players are explicitly taught the new dash/attack and coin reward loop. I’m rebuilding your EXE now so you can test the upgraded feel immediately.
- L3214 | `change` | files: - | Implemented a full “feel + pressure + progression” pass.
- L3219 | `change` | files: - | Added Dash mechanic (burst movement + cooldown + enemy break on contact).
- L3220 | `change` | files: - | Added Attack mechanic (short-range hit with cooldown).
- L3221 | `change` | files: - | Added Landing impact feedback (camera shake + landing beep on hard landings).
- L3227 | `change` | files: - | Added enemy state flow for aggressive types: patrol -> windup -> lunge -> recover.
- L3232 | `change` | files: - | Added coin milestone rewards:
- L3237 | `change` | files: - | Added toast callouts when rewards trigger.
- L3244 | `change` | files: - | Added toast display in UI for rewards/combat events.
- L3247 | `change` | files: - | Tutorial updated
- L3251 | `change` | files: - | Build
- L3252 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt executable successfully:
- L3261 | `change` | files: - | I’ve patched it; now I’ll rebuild the EXE so you can test the corrected dash behavior immediately.
- L3263 | `change` | files: - | Fixed. Dash was capped by normal max velocity, so it couldn’t exceed walk/run speed.
- L3273 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt EXE:
- L3279 | `change` | files: - | Make sure the version number with new build is always up to date
- L3281 | `change` | files: - | I’ll automate version stamping in the build pipeline so every new EXE writes a fresh build version and the game always shows that value (even if old settings are cached). I’m adding a generated build-info file plus a build-step in your .bat.
- L3283 | `change` | files: build-info.js | I’m now adding a generated build-info.js and forcing currentVersion from that build stamp on startup, so cached settings can’t show stale versions. Then I’ll rebuild the EXE to confirm.
- L3285 | `change` | files: - | I’ve wired auto-version stamping into the build flow and locked runtime version to that stamp. I’ll run a fresh build now so you get an EXE with a guaranteed current version label.
- L3287 | `change` | files: - | Done. Versioning is now automatic per build.
- L3291 | `change` | files: - | Added build stamp generator:
- L3293 | `change` | files: - | Added generated runtime build info file:
- L3294 | `change` | files: build-info.js | build-info.js
- L3295 | `change` | files: - | Wired build info into app load order:
- L3296 | `change` | files: build-info.js, index.html | index.html now loads build-info.js before settings
- L3297 | `change` | files: - | Forced settings version to always follow current build (ignores stale localStorage):
- L3299 | `change` | files: - | Locked Options “Current version” to build version (read-only):
- L3301 | `change` | files: - | Added build step in packaging script:
- L3303 | `change` | files: - | Added debug startup line with build version/time:
- L3307 | `change` | files: build_portable_exe.bat | Every time you run build_portable_exe.bat, a new version is generated (format: YYYY.MM.DD.HHMM).
- L3309 | `change` | files: - | Latest build version generated:
- L3313 | `change` | files: - | How can I update within the game without restarting?
- L3317 | `change` | files: - | In your current architecture (single-file desktop EXE + local bundled assets), an update requires:
- L3324 | `change` | files: - | Check update status from Main Menu Update
- L3325 | `change` | files: - | Click Download and fetch the new build automatically
- L3328 | `change` | files: - | Update + Restart button (downloads new EXE to temp, launches updater helper, closes game, replaces EXE, relaunches)
- L3332 | `change` | files: - | Update + Restart button (downloads new EXE to temp, launches updater helper, closes game, replaces EXE, relaunches)
- L3336 | `change` | files: - | But we need an update helper somehwere else right? Something like github?
- L3338 | `change` | files: - | Yes, correct: you need a hosted source for updates (GitHub Releases works well). I’ll still implement the full in-app Update + Restart flow now (download -> helper script swap -> relaunch, with rollback and progress logs), and then I’ll show exactly what you must host.
- L3340 | `change` | files: - | I’ve wired the in-app updater flow and rollback helper. I’m doing a quick backend sanity check and then rebuilding the EXE so Update+Restart is live.
- L3342 | `change` | files: - | Yes. You need a hosted source for update files. GitHub is a good choice.
- L3344 | `change` | files: - | Implemented now:
- L3346 | `change` | files: - | Update+Restart in main menu.
- L3350 | `change` | files: - | menu update status text
- L3351 | `change` | files: - | bottom-left update line
- L3353 | `change` | files: - | Files updated:
- L3357 | `change` | files: menu-scene.js | menu-scene.js (Update+Restart UI behavior)
- L3358 | `change` | files: - | New build:
- L3360 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | AnimePlatformer.exe (updated)
- L3363 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Upload the latest AnimePlatformer.exe to a release.
- L3370 | `change` | files: - | Online update check = On
- L3372 | `change` | files: - | Then players can update from inside the game with one button.
- L3377 | `change` | files: - | Understood. I’m switching to automatic background updating so players don’t need to manage versions manually: on menu load, the game will check, download, apply, and restart by itself when a newer build exists. I’m implementing this now.
- L3379 | `change` | files: - | Auto-update behavior is in. I’m rebuilding now so the executable performs background update-and-restart automatically when a newer version is detected.
- L3381 | `change` | files: - | Auto-update behavior is in place in the menu flow now. I’m rebuilding your EXE so this ships immediately with background update + auto-restart enabled by default.
- L3388 | `change` | files: - | If newer version exists and auto-update is enabled:
- L3392 | `change` | files: - | applies update via helper script
- L3397 | `change` | files: - | Where this is implemented:
- L3400 | `change` | files: updater.js | updater.js: update orchestration + progress polling
- L3401 | `change` | files: menu-scene.js | menu-scene.js: automatic update trigger + status UI
- L3403 | `change` | files: options-scene.js | options-scene.js: toggle for auto-update
- L3404 | `change` | files: - | New build:
- L3407 | `change` | files: - | Build version: 2026.02.15.0911
- L3416 | `root-cause` | files: - | I found the root cause: resize is oscillating between window size and pywebview outer-window size, which floods logs and leaves menu layout stuck at old dimensions. I’m fixing this by using a single resize authority and making the main menu relayout dynamically on every resize.
- L3418 | `change` | files: - | I removed the resize tug-of-war and made the menu truly responsive to runtime resizes. I’m rebuilding now so you can verify both fixes in the EXE.
- L3422 | `change` | files: - | Fixed both issues.
- L3427 | `change` | files: - | Removed pywebview size polling as a competing resize source.
- L3431 | `change` | files: - | Fixed menu layout on resize/fullscreen
- L3433 | `change` | files: - | Background layers, title, buttons, update widget, and version text now reposition/resize dynamically.
- L3436 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt EXE successfully
- L3437 | `change` | files: - | New build version: 2026.02.15.0914
- L3441 | `change` | files: - | One rebuild initially failed because the EXE was still running (WinError 5 file lock). I closed the running process and rebuilt successfully.
- L3452 | `change` | files: - | I fixed it with two changes:
- L3460 | `change` | files: - | Updated files:
- L3464 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt EXE:
- L3468 | `change` | files: - | If you still see a right-side gap with this build, send one new screenshot + copied latest debug block, and I’ll lock it further at the pywebview host level (content-size sync from Python side).
- L3474 | `change` | files: - | You’re right. The menu is now filling correctly, but the layout is scaling with full window size, which shifts perceived button positions. I’m locking the menu composition to a fixed design frame (centered) so fullscreen won’t “zoom” the UI layout anymore.
- L3478 | `change` | files: - | Adjusted. The menu now uses a fixed design frame (1366x768) centered inside the window, so fullscreen won’t shift UI composition.
- L3482 | `change` | files: - | Buttons/title/update widget stay in consistent visual positions.
- L3487 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt EXE:
- L3493 | `change` | files: - | Build failed once because the EXE was still running/locked; I stopped it and rebuilt successfully.
- L3503 | `change` | files: - | Switched menu reference frame from 1366x768 to the original game design size 960x540.
- L3504 | `change` | files: - | Kept centering logic, so layout position stays consistent while avoiding the “zoomed-in / moved buttons” effect.
- L3508 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt EXE:
- L3524 | `change` | files: - | remove the centered 960-frame offset so menu positions stay where expected on fullscreen.
- L3527 | `change` | files: - | Fixed with a proper rendering/DPI pass.
- L3534 | `change` | files: - | Added ?desktop=1 URL flag from launcher
- L3536 | `change` | files: - | Added sharper render settings:
- L3539 | `change` | files: - | Removed the centered design-frame offset in menu layout so button placement matches expected fullscreen positions.
- L3541 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt EXE:
- L3557 | `change` | files: - | Fixed the boot error.
- L3559 | `root-cause` | files: - | Root cause:
- L3564 | `change` | files: - | Removed query-string URL hack from launcher.
- L3566 | `change` | files: - | Switched desktop detection in JS to runtime bridge check (window.pywebview), no URL mutation needed.
- L3570 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt EXE:
- L3574 | `change` | files: - | Please run this build. If blur/layout is still off after this, I’ll add one more hard fix: explicit device-pixel-ratio scaling lock + font-size normalization by DPR in the menu scene.
- L3580 | `change` | files: - | You’re describing classic input/canvas desync under fullscreen DPI scaling. I’m applying a hard fix now: remove manual canvas CSS resizing, refresh Phaser scale/input mapping after each resize, and lock desktop rendering to sharper DPR settings.
- L3582 | `change` | files: - | Implemented a direct desync fix:
- L3584 | `change` | files: - | Removed manual canvas CSS resizing (that can offset hit-tests in fullscreen).
- L3588 | `change` | files: - | Added DPR-aware render resolution (1..2) for sharper output.
- L3589 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt EXE.
- L3590 | `change` | files: - | New build:
- L3597 | `change` | files: - | Great that works, now the update thingy, as of now it says: " manifest URL is empty", no casual gamer would know hwat a manifest url is so we're gonna do that fro them, remember " Plug & play"
- L3600 | `change` | files: - | I can make this fully plug-and-play by shipping the update endpoints preconfigured so players never see “manifest URL.”
- L3615 | `change` | files: - | Plug-and-Play Auto-Update (No Manifest UX for Players)
- L3617 | `change` | files: - | We will remove all player-facing update configuration and make updates fully automatic using GitHub Releases as the default backend.
- L3624 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Build target: single EXE in root (AnimePlatformer.exe)
- L3628 | `change` | files: - | No update settings required in-game
- L3634 | `change` | files: - | Build-time auto configuration of update endpoints
- L3637 | `change` | files: - | Safe update swap with backup/rollback
- L3644 | `change` | files: - | Build-time inputs (new, developer-facing)
- L3645 | `change` | files: - | Add one source of truth used by build script:
- L3650 | `change` | files: - | These values are consumed by build tooling and written into generated runtime config (not player-entered).
- L3654 | `change` | files: - | Remove/disable editable manifest fields from Options UI.
- L3657 | `change` | files: - | Update mode (Auto updates ON/OFF)
- L3658 | `change` | files: - | Last update status
- L3662 | `change` | files: - | 1. Build-time config generation
- L3663 | `change` | files: write_build_info.py | Extend write_build_info.py to also emit update defaults:
- L3668 | `change` | files: build_portable_exe.bat | Build script (build_portable_exe.bat) exports/parses repo/channel once and invokes generator.
- L3671 | `change` | files: - | Fallback: GitHub API latest release endpoint adapter in updater logic
- L3672 | `change` | files: - | Result: every build embeds working update endpoints automatically.
- L3677 | `change` | files: - | build-generated repo config
- L3684 | `change` | files: - | “Can’t reach update server”
- L3685 | `change` | files: - | “No update available”
- L3686 | `change` | files: - | “Downloading update…”
- L3687 | `change` | files: - | “Restarting to finish update…”
- L3689 | `change` | files: - | Main menu update widget text changes:
- L3694 | `change` | files: - | “Update found, downloading…”
- L3695 | `change` | files: - | “Applying update…”
- L3696 | `change` | files: - | Keep manual Update button as fallback/debug trigger, but label/user flow remains plain-language.
- L3699 | `change` | files: - | Remove/hide:
- L3703 | `change` | files: - | Auto update ON/OFF
- L3704 | `change` | files: - | maybe “Update source: GitHub Releases” read-only
- L3707 | `change` | files: - | 5. Desktop updater safety hardening
- L3720 | `change` | files: - | ignore for normal flow when build repo config exists
- L3728 | `change` | files: - | status: “Update server busy, try later”
- L3731 | `change` | files: - | status: “Update download failed”
- L3741 | `change` | files: - | Newer release available:
- L3751 | `change` | files: - | Bottom-left update line remains friendly and stable.
- L3752 | `change` | files: - | Manual update button still works as fallback.
- L3758 | `change` | files: - | Update host: GitHub Releases
- L3759 | `change` | files: - | Update mode: Auto background + auto restart in menu
- L3760 | `change` | files: - | Player UI hides all technical update configuration
- L3761 | `change` | files: - | Build embeds update source once; players never configure it
- L3773 | `change` | files: - | I’m implementing this end-to-end now with GitHub Releases as the built-in source and no manifest fields in player UI. First step is updating build-time config + updater APIs, then I’ll refactor menu/options text and rebuild.
- L3775 | `change` | files: - | Implementing this now end-to-end: I’ll patch build-time config + updater source priority + UI wording, then rebuild the EXE to verify plug-and-play behavior with no manifest terminology for players. I’m starting by scanning the current update-related files to apply targeted edits.
- L3777 | `change` | files: - | I found the relevant files; next I’m editing update config generation and runtime updater/UI integration so the player never sees technical URLs. I’ll patch the Python build script, batch build script, JS settings/updater/menu/options, and launcher API together for consistency.
- L3779 | `change` | files: - | I’ve isolated the update stack. I’m now applying a coordinated patch to remove player-facing manifest fields, add build-embedded GitHub repo/channel defaults, and switch runtime checks to plain-language GitHub-based auto-updates with legacy fallback only behind the scenes.
- L3781 | `change` | files: - | I’ve switched menu messaging to non-technical update states. Next patch removes manifest/download controls from Options while keeping auto-update toggles and read-only source/version details.
- L3785 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Validation passed. I’m now rebuilding AnimePlatformer.exe so the new update flow is embedded and ready to test in the desktop build.
- L3787 | `change` | files: - | Build succeeded. I noticed one logic edge case: when no repo is embedded yet, status can read like updates are off. I’m patching that to show a clear non-technical “not configured yet” message instead.
- L3789 | `change` | files: - | Implemented. The game now uses a plug-and-play auto-update flow with no player-facing manifest/download URL UX.
- L3793 | `change` | files: - | Build-time update config embedding
- L3802 | `change` | files: - | Runtime update source priority + friendly messaging
- L3805 | `change` | files: - | build-embedded GitHub repo
- L3807 | `change` | files: - | Added plain-language statuses/errors:
- L3810 | `change` | files: - | “Can’t reach update server.”
- L3811 | `change` | files: - | “Update server busy, try later.”
- L3812 | `change` | files: - | “Downloading update...”
- L3813 | `change` | files: - | “Restarting to finish update...”
- L3817 | `change` | files: - | Removed visible Manifest/Download URL inputs.
- L3819 | `change` | files: - | update enabled
- L3820 | `change` | files: - | auto update
- L3821 | `change` | files: - | update source (read-only)
- L3823 | `change` | files: - | Menu update UX cleanup
- L3825 | `change` | files: - | Updated widget/bottom-left text to friendly wording.
- L3826 | `change` | files: - | Kept manual Update fallback button.
- L3827 | `change` | files: - | Auto-update messaging is now non-technical.
- L3828 | `change` | files: - | Desktop updater backend hardening
- L3830 | `change` | files: - | Added check_update_github(repo, current_version, channel).
- L3831 | `change` | files: - | Pulls release data from GitHub API and picks .exe asset first.
- L3833 | `change` | files: - | Added clearer error messages and basic download-size guard.
- L3836 | `change` | files: - | Build config is authoritative for update mode defaults.
- L3838 | `change` | files: - | Build output
- L3840 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt successfully.
- L3845 | `change` | files: - | Since UPDATE_GH_REPO was empty during this build, UI will show: Updates are not configured yet.
- L3848 | `change` | files: - | Run build with repo set (public releases):
- L3861 | `change` | files: - | I also added runtime normalization to handle accidental leading/trailing slashes in repo values, then I’ll rebuild with your repo.
- L3863 | `change` | files: - | Done. I embedded your repo as the auto-update source and rebuilt.
- L3869 | `change` | files: - | Build version: 2026.02.15.1021
- L3872 | `change` | files: - | For plug-and-play updates to work for players, the repo’s Releases must be public and include the new .exe asset in each release.
- L3875 | `change` | files: - | I’ll verify the GitHub release endpoint for zyynx-hub/Platformer and map the exact failure to a clearer in-game status so it says what’s wrong (for example: no release published yet vs network issue).
- L3877 | `change` | files: - | The endpoint returns 404 Not Found, so the game cannot find a public “latest release” for that repo yet. I’ll make the in-game message explicit (No public release found yet) instead of generic network failure.
- L3879 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Build failed because AnimePlatformer.exe is currently running/locked. I’ll stop the process, rebuild, and deliver the updated EXE with the clearer update status message.
- L3884 | `change` | files: - | I updated the game to show a clearer message and rebuilt:
- L3888 | `change` | files: - | New update message for this case: No public release found yet.
- L3892 | `change` | files: - | Publish at least one GitHub Release.
- L3893 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Attach the built AnimePlatformer.exe as a release asset.
- L3897 | `change` | files: - | Well I need you to stop being dependend on the program being active, it should always push to github and get updates from there
- L3899 | `change` | files: - | I’m changing the build pipeline so it can build and publish even while the game EXE is running. The build will go to a separate output path, then auto-publish to GitHub Releases using a token, and only best-effort copy to root if unlocked.
- L3901 | `change` | files: - | I added a GitHub release publisher script and rewired the build to publish automatically when a token is present. I’m running a validation build now to confirm it no longer depends on the root EXE being writable.
- L3903 | `change` | files: - | Implemented. Build/publish is no longer blocked by the running EXE.
- L3912 | `change` | files: - | Creates/fetches release for current build version.
- L3918 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Fresh build produced: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L3920 | `change` | files: - | If root EXE is running/locked, build and GitHub publish can still proceed.
- L3925 | `change` | files: - | Then every build:
- L3931 | `change` | files: - | If you want, I can also add a GitHub Actions workflow so releases are published automatically on tag push (no local token needed for publishing).
- L3934 | `change` | files: - | Push to repo
- L3936 | `change` | files: - | I’m preparing a clean commit and push now: I’ll check git status/remote, commit the updater pipeline changes, and push to your current branch.
- L3938 | `change` | files: - | This folder is not a Git repository (.git missing), so I can’t push from here yet. I’ll quickly check parent folders for an existing repo location so we can push without re-setup if possible.
- L3940 | `change` | files: - | I checked zyynx-hub/Platformer: it appears to have no refs yet (empty repo), so I can initialize this folder and push as first commit safely. I’ll add a sane .gitignore first to avoid committing build artifacts and temp binaries.
- L3942 | `change` | files: - | The parallel call glitched after init; I’m re-running git steps sequentially to complete commit/push safely.
- L3944 | `change` | files: - | Commit was blocked by missing git identity. I’m setting repo-local identity (zyynx-hub + GitHub noreply) so push can proceed immediately.
- L3949 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 3e97e15
- L3951 | `change` | files: - | I also initialized git in this project, added a .gitignore, and committed the current full source state (including your updater pipeline changes).
- L3955 | `change` | files: - | Still same update service not reachable message
- L3957 | `change` | files: - | You’re right. That message is coming from a fallback path, not the proper desktop GitHub updater bridge. I’m patching it so desktop waits/retries for the bridge and shows a clear status (No public release found yet) instead of generic “service not reachable.”
- L3959 | `change` | files: - | Fixed.
- L3963 | `change` | files: - | Added retry logic when the desktop update bridge isn’t ready yet.
- L3964 | `change` | files: - | Changed 404 mapping to a clear player message: No public release found yet.
- L3965 | `change` | files: - | Stopped using the misleading generic Update service not reachable in that case.
- L3969 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | AnimePlatformer.exe updated in root.
- L3978 | `change` | files: - | Still same message, client should force close, only push to github and get update status from there
- L3980 | `change` | files: - | I’ll remove all non-GitHub update paths and force a GitHub-only check flow, then make the build script terminate the running game before replacing/publishing so stale EXEs can’t keep showing old messages. I’m patching this now.
- L3982 | `change` | files: desktop_launcher.py | I found the exact cause: desktop_launcher.py still had one old fallback string in the GitHub path. I’m removing that, dropping manifest fallback entirely, and making the build script force-close the running client before replacing the root EXE.
- L3984 | `change` | files: - | Now I’ll rebuild, verify the old phrase is gone from source/build output, and push this fix to GitHub.
- L3986 | `change` | files: - | Done. I implemented exactly that behavior.
- L3989 | `change` | files: - | GitHub-only update source
- L3990 | `change` | files: - | Removed manifest/legacy update path from runtime updater logic.
- L3991 | `change` | files: - | Update checks now use only:
- L3992 | `change` | files: - | build-embedded repo (zyynx-hub/Platformer)
- L3994 | `change` | files: - | Removed old message source
- L3995 | `change` | files: desktop_launcher.py | Fixed remaining old string in desktop_launcher.py so 404 now maps to:
- L3996 | `change` | files: - | No public release found yet.
- L3997 | `change` | files: - | The phrase Update service not reachable. is no longer in current source.
- L3998 | `change` | files: - | Force-close client during build replacement
- L4002 | `change` | files: - | Commit pushed: 933fd80
- L4006 | `change` | files: - | You were running an older binary instance. With the new build logic, this is now force-closed during build replacement.
- L4008 | `change` | files: - | Current build
- L4010 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Root EXE updated: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L4014 | `change` | files: - | So when we release a new build it should get repo from github right?
- L4020 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | You build and publish a new release to zyynx-hub/Platformer (with AnimePlatformer.exe attached).
- L4023 | `change` | files: - | So the client always reads update status from GitHub Releases for that repo.
- L4028 | `change` | files: - | I’ll run an actual end-to-end smoke test of the new updater path: GitHub check behavior, message mapping, and build/replacement flow. I’m starting with direct updater API calls through the launcher backend.
- L4030 | `change` | files: - | Backend test passed for both no-release and release repos. Next I’ll verify the runtime updater is now GitHub-only and no manifest fallback is still active.
- L4034 | `change` | files: - | Confirmed by scan: no manifest fallback usage remains in updater logic, and the old Update service not reachable text is absent from JS. I’ll run one more check for the active GitHub bridge call and then summarize test results.
- L4036 | `change` | files: - | Tested. Current GitHub-update feature behavior is working as implemented.
- L4041 | `change` | files: - | zyynx-hub/Platformer (no public latest release yet):
- L4043 | `change` | files: - | Control repo with a public release (phaserjs/phaser):
- L4049 | `change` | files: - | No public release found yet. is present in both JS and Python paths.
- L4050 | `change` | files: - | Old Update service not reachable string is no longer present in current source.
- L4051 | `change` | files: - | Build replacement behavior
- L4052 | `change` | files: - | Build script includes forced close before root EXE replace:
- L4055 | `change` | files: - | You were almost certainly running an older EXE instance/cached build before replacement. Current code paths now map 404 to No public release found yet.
- L4057 | `change` | files: - | If you want, I can now do a full live validation by publishing a test release asset to your repo and then confirming in-game status transitions end-to-end.
- L4062 | `change` | files: - | I’m running a true end-to-end release test now: verify current GitHub release state, publish a real release asset, then re-check updater responses before/after to confirm the client path works.
- L4071 | `change` | files: - | So the updater logic is working, but there is still no published release asset and no auth token available in this environment to publish one automatically.
- L4084 | `change` | files: - | Menu status shows update found/downloading flow.
- L4099 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | After that, launch AnimePlatformer.exe and the update check will read from GitHub automatically.
- L4102 | `change` | files: - | 14241 INFO: Build complete! The results are available in: C:\Users\Robin\Desktop\codex\build\portable_out

- L4109 | `change` | files: - | [build] GitHub publish failed.
- L4111 | `change` | files: - | Your build succeeded. Publish failed because token auth is invalid (401 Bad credentials).
- L4131 | `change` | files: - | Quick token sanity check before full build:

- L4134 | `change` | files: - | If auth is correct, it will print created/updated release + uploaded asset URL.
- L4137 | `change` | files: C:\Users\Robin\Desktop\codex\AnimePlatformer.exe | [build] Root EXE updated: C:\Users\Robin\Desktop\codex\AnimePlatformer.exe
- L4139 | `change` | files: - | [build] GitHub publish failed.
- L4143 | `change` | files: - | 404 on create-a-release means GitHub is treating the repo as inaccessible for that token, not that build failed.
- L4191 | `change` | files: - | I’ll use this token only in-memory for this session to test/publish now, then I’ll report the result and what to rotate afterward for safety. Running auth check and release publish next.
- L4197 | `change` | files: - | Publish fails for same reason: release endpoint returns 404
- L4214 | `change` | files: build\portable_out\AnimePlatformer.exe, scripts\publish_github_release.py | py scripts\publish_github_release.py --repo "zyynx-hub/Platformer" --channel "stable" --exe "build\portable_out\AnimePlatformer.exe"
- L4215 | `change` | files: - | If that succeeds, in-game updater will start reading real release status from GitHub automatically.
- L4220 | `change` | files: - | [publish] Success repo=zyynx-hub/Platformer tag=2026.02.15.1045 channel=stable
- L4222 | `change` | files: - | Build complete.

- L4234 | `change` | files: - | Release created/tagged: 2026.02.15.1045
- L4236 | `change` | files: - | Public asset URL generated
- L4237 | `change` | files: - | Build finished with plug-and-play EXE
- L4241 | `change` | files: - | Client checks zyynx-hub/Platformer and gets live update status.
- L4242 | `change` | files: - | Players no longer need manual update config.
- L4245 | `change` | files: - | Run current game build and confirm bottom-left says You're up to date. for 2026.02.15.1045.
- L4246 | `change` | files: - | Build once more (new version), publish, then verify old build shows update available and applies restart flow.
- L4251 | `change` | files: - | I’ll verify the public GitHub endpoint right now from outside auth. If it still returns 404, the repo/release isn’t publicly visible to players (most likely private repo), which explains this exact message.
- L4253 | `root-cause` | files: - | Root cause is confirmed: your update repo is not publicly reachable.
- L4259 | `change` | files: - | So the game correctly shows No public release found yet.
- L4264 | `change` | files: - | Ensure the release is published (not draft) and not prerelease for stable.
- L4283 | `change` | files: - | Then your game should stop showing No public release found yet. and start showing live update status.
- L4288 | `change` | files: - | Great, I’ll verify the public GitHub release endpoint now and confirm what the game should show.
- L4292 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Public endpoint returns 200 with release 2026.02.15.1045 and asset AnimePlatformer.exe.
- L4297 | `change` | files: - | Update: You're up to date.
- L4301 | `change` | files: - | Works, great! Now make a new release to check if updating works ingame
- L4303 | `change` | files: - | I’ll create a new build and publish a fresh GitHub Release now so your currently installed 2026.02.15.1045 can detect and update in-game. I’ll do it without the force-close build script to avoid interrupting your running game.
- L4305 | `change` | files: - | I don’t have a token in this shell session, so I’m using the token you already provided to publish this test release now. After this test, rotate it again for safety.
- L4307 | `change` | files: - | Build metadata is now bumped to a newer version. I’m compiling the new EXE and then publishing that release asset to GitHub.
- L4309 | `change` | files: - | I started the test release process and built a new version:
- L4311 | `change` | files: - | New build version generated: 2026.02.15.1049
- L4316 | `change` | files: - | So I can’t finish the release publish from this shell right now.
- L4318 | `change` | files: - | Run this locally with a fresh token, then I’ll verify the in-game update immediately:
- L4321 | `change` | files: build\portable_out\AnimePlatformer.exe, scripts\publish_github_release.py | py scripts\publish_github_release.py --repo "zyynx-hub/Platformer" --channel "stable" --exe "build\portable_out\AnimePlatformer.exe"
- L4322 | `change` | files: - | If that succeeds, your running 2026.02.15.1045 client should detect 2026.02.15.1049 as an update in menu.
- L4327 | `change` | files: - | Correct. Set the new token in this terminal, then I can run the publish + update test immediately.
- L4334 | `change` | files: - | publish the new 2026.02.15.1049 release,
- L4376 | `change` | files: - | I’ll use this new token now to publish the already-built 2026.02.15.1049 release, then verify the live GitHub endpoint and updater response.
- L4378 | `change` | files: - | Publish succeeded, but GitHub releases/latest is still returning 1045. I’m checking the 1049 release metadata now (likely marked as prerelease/draft or missing published timestamp), then I’ll patch/fix it so latest points to 1049.
- L4380 | `change` | files: - | Success. I completed the live update test.
- L4384 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Published new release 2026.02.15.1049 with AnimePlatformer.exe.
- L4385 | `change` | files: - | Fixed GitHub “latest” pointer to that release (make_latest=true).
- L4386 | `change` | files: - | Verified updater response from old build version.
- L4396 | `change` | files: - | Update found (2026.02.15.1049) then download/apply/restart flow.
- L4403 | `change` | files: - | I’m also hardening the UI-side mapping so if this Windows-specific network error ever bubbles up again, players get a clean actionable status instead of raw [WinError 87].
- L4405 | `change` | files: - | New build is ready, but release publish failed because the token is invalid again.
- L4413 | `change` | files: build\portable_out\AnimePlatformer.exe, scripts\publish_github_release.py | py scripts\publish_github_release.py --repo "zyynx-hub/Platformer" --channel "stable" --exe "build\portable_out\AnimePlatformer.exe"
- L4414 | `change` | files: - | After that, your 2026.02.15.1045 game should detect 2026.02.15.1055 as update.
- L4419 | `change` | files: - | Done, make new release to check if update works
- L4421 | `change` | files: - | I’ll create and publish another new release right now by bumping build version, compiling, and uploading to GitHub so your current client can detect it as a fresh update target.
- L4423 | `change` | files: - | Version bumped to 2026.02.15.1058. I’m building the new EXE and publishing this release now.
- L4425 | `change` | files: - | New build is ready (2026.02.15.1058), but I couldn’t publish from this session because no token is available in my shell.
- L4430 | `change` | files: build\portable_out\AnimePlatformer.exe, scripts\publish_github_release.py | py scripts\publish_github_release.py --repo "zyynx-hub/Platformer" --channel "stable" --exe "build\portable_out\AnimePlatformer.exe"
- L4431 | `change` | files: - | After that, your running 2026.02.15.1045 client should detect update 2026.02.15.1058 in menu.
- L4434 | `change` | files: - | I want you to push it to github, I dont want it to do it myself everytime
- L4436 | `change` | files: - | I can make this hands-free: I’ll set up GitHub Actions so releases are built/published automatically on tag push, then I’ll push a 2026.02.15.1058 tag now so GitHub publishes this test release without needing local PAT publishing. I’m implementing that now.
- L4438 | `change` | files: - | I’m adding a CI workflow that builds Windows EXE and creates a GitHub Release automatically when a version tag is pushed.
- L4440 | `change` | files: - | I’ll commit and push the workflow, then push tag 2026.02.15.1058 so GitHub builds and publishes automatically.
- L4442 | `change` | files: - | Commit is created; I’m pushing it now (the earlier parallel push ran before commit completed).
- L4444 | `change` | files: - | Now I’m pushing the release tag 2026.02.15.1058 to trigger GitHub Actions auto-build + auto-release.
- L4446 | `change` | files: - | I’ve triggered the release workflow. I’ll quickly check if the Actions run started and report the direct link/status.
- L4448 | `change` | files: - | Done. I set this up so you don’t need local release-token publishing each time.
- L4452 | `change` | files: release.yml | Added GitHub Actions workflow: release.yml
- L4453 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | It auto-builds AnimePlatformer.exe and publishes a GitHub Release when you push a version tag.
- L4455 | `change` | files: - | commit 8078b0f
- L4456 | `change` | files: - | tag 2026.02.15.1058 (this triggers the release workflow)
- L4457 | `change` | files: - | So from now on, release publishing can happen on GitHub side (no local GH_TOKEN needed for publish step).
- L4462 | `change` | files: - | Then open the latest Build and Release EXE run.
- L4467 | `change` | files: - | creates/pushes tag,
- L4470 | `change` | files: - | So everytime you create a new build and I have the game open, no force closes happens and the game updates when available?
- L4474 | `change` | files: - | I push code + a new version tag.
- L4475 | `change` | files: - | GitHub Actions builds and publishes the new EXE release.
- L4477 | `change` | files: - | In main menu, updater sees the new release and applies update via Update + Restart.
- L4478 | `change` | files: - | Only when applying the update does the app close/restart. It should not force-close just because a new build was created on GitHub.
- L4483 | `change` | files: - | Perfect. I’m triggering a real release test now by pushing a brand-new version tag so GitHub builds/publishes automatically, then I’ll give you exact in-game steps to validate live updating.
- L4485 | `change` | files: desktop_launcher.py, updater.js | I found two local modifications not yet on GitHub (desktop_launcher.py, updater.js). I’ll commit/push those first so the test release includes the latest updater fixes, then push a new test tag.
- L4487 | `change` | files: - | Tag pushed: 2026.02.15.1100. GitHub Actions should now be building and publishing that release automatically. I’ll do a quick live check if the release page is up yet.
- L4489 | `change` | files: - | I pushed the test release tag and the pipeline is running/queued, but GitHub API checks are rate-limited from this IP right now. I’m doing one more non-API check of the public Actions page to confirm the workflow run appears.
- L4496 | `change` | files: - | new release test tag: 2026.02.15.1100
- L4497 | `change` | files: - | That should auto-build and auto-publish via GitHub Actions.
- L4504 | `change` | files: - | Click Update (or let auto-check run).
- L4505 | `change` | files: - | You should see Update found (2026.02.15.1100) and then download/apply/restart.
- L4509 | `change` | files: - | and send me the status of the latest Build and Release EXE run (success/fail).
- L4511 | `change` | files: - | I’m going to harden update checks so they don’t depend solely on GitHub’s API (which can fail/rate-limit). I’ll add a fallback that reads the latest release tag from github.com/.../releases/latest redirect, then rebuild and push.
- L4513 | `change` | files: - | I added the non-API fallback path. I’m rebuilding now so your running client can pick this fix on next restart and avoid fragile API-only behavior.
- L4515 | `change` | files: - | Applied a fix for your error path and rebuilt.
- L4520 | `change` | files: - | If API fails/rate-limits/proxy-breaks, it resolves latest tag via https://github.com/<repo>/releases/latest redirect.
- L4522 | `change` | files: - | New build:
- L4525 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Root EXE updated: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L4529 | `change` | files: - | In main menu, check update status again.
- L4541 | `change` | files: - | From 2026.02.15.1045 -> update detected to 2026.02.15.1055 with valid EXE URL.
- L4542 | `change` | files: - | From 2026.02.15.1106 -> reports up to date vs latest published release (1055).
- L4545 | `change` | files: - | Still detected update to 2026.02.15.1055.
- L4548 | `change` | files: - | The new fallback is functional and prevents API-only failure from breaking update checks.
- L4550 | `change` | files: - | If you want, I can now push a fresh tag so GitHub Actions publishes 1106 (or newer) and you can verify the full in-game update flow from your currently installed version.
- L4553 | `change` | files: - | Yes, test with new update to check if everything is working, also, add a neat little dropdown menu with "What has changed" to let the user know what were working on
- L4555 | `change` | files: - | I’m implementing both now: I’ll add a “What’s Changed” dropdown in the main menu (fed by release notes), then push a brand-new tagged release to verify update detection end-to-end.
- L4557 | `change` | files: - | I’m adding release-note fields to updater results, then wiring a menu dropdown panel that shows “What’s Changed” from the latest release body. After that I’ll push a fresh tag for a real update test.
- L4559 | `change` | files: - | Now I’m patching the menu scene to add a clean “What’s Changed” dropdown panel and populate it from latest release notes during update checks.
- L4561 | `change` | files: - | UI change is in. I’m now committing/pushing this and tagging a new release so you can test live in-game update detection plus the new dropdown notes panel.
- L4563 | `change` | files: - | Git left a stale lock file. I’ll clear it safely and re-run commit/push, then create the new release tag.
- L4565 | `change` | files: - | Done. I pushed both changes and triggered a live update test release.
- L4569 | `change` | files: - | Added “What’s Changed” dropdown in main menu.
- L4570 | `change` | files: - | It shows latest release notes from GitHub release body.
- L4571 | `change` | files: - | Hardened updater fallback so API issues don’t break checks.
- L4574 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 76f7abc
- L4575 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1112 (triggers auto build/release via GitHub Actions)
- L4581 | `change` | files: - | You should get update detection for 2026.02.15.1112.
- L4583 | `change` | files: - | It should show release notes text for latest release.
- L4584 | `change` | files: - | Apply update and verify restart into new version.
- L4585 | `change` | files: - | If update doesn’t appear after a few minutes, send screenshot of:
- L4588 | `change` | files: - | and your bottom-left in-game update text.

- L5003 | `change` | files: - | I’m pushing this CI fix and tagging a fresh release trigger so Actions reruns with the correct interpreter.
- L5005 | `root-cause` | files: - | Exactly the right failure log. Root cause is confirmed:
- L5008 | `change` | files: - | That pulled pythonnet build path again and failed.
- L5009 | `change` | files: - | I fixed CI by replacing all py ... calls with python ... in workflow.
- L5013 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 55ac9d6
- L5014 | `change` | files: - | New release trigger tag: 2026.02.15.1124
- L5021 | `change` | files: - | SOURCE: MenuScene.update
- L5026 | `change` | files: - | Great report. I’m fixing this directly in the desktop updater apply step: I’ll make launcher startup flags fallback-safe on Windows so WinError 87 can’t break update apply/restart anymore, then rebuild and push.
- L5028 | `change` | files: - | I patched the exact crash path. I’ll rebuild and push this fix, then trigger another release tag so your in-game updater can test the corrected apply flow.
- L5030 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and retested pipeline on my side:
- L5032 | `change` | files: - | Patched updater apply flow to recover from WinError 87 when launching helper.
- L5033 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt locally and pushed fix.
- L5034 | `change` | files: - | Pushed new release trigger tag: 2026.02.15.1130.
- L5037 | `root-cause` | files: - | previous pythonnet failure root cause is addressed (python interpreter path now used in workflow).
- L5040 | `change` | files: - | Wait for GitHub Actions run for tag 2026.02.15.1130 to finish.
- L5041 | `change` | files: - | In-game on current version, click Update.
- L5048 | `change` | files: - | Also in whats changed "No detailed notes in this release"
- L5050 | `change` | files: - | I’ll fix both now: 1) make post-update restart more reliable so the game auto-boots after closing, and 2) clean the menu layout so “You’re up to date” no longer overlaps the “What’s Changed” button, with better fallback text in the changelog panel.
- L5052 | `change` | files: - | I’ve applied both fixes. I’m rebuilding and pushing a fresh tag so you can test update-restart behavior and the corrected menu UI immediately.
- L5054 | `change` | files: - | Fixed both issues and pushed a fresh test release trigger.
- L5058 | `change` | files: - | Auto-boot after update close
- L5059 | `change` | files: - | Hardened updater helper launch:
- L5064 | `change` | files: - | Moved What's Changed button lower so it no longer overlaps You're up to date.
- L5066 | `change` | files: - | Replaced “No detailed notes in this release” with:
- L5070 | `change` | files: - | Commit: b9ccee9
- L5071 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1135 (new Actions release trigger)
- L5075 | `change` | files: - | In current game build, go menu and update.
- L5078 | `change` | files: - | update closes and reboots automatically
- L5081 | `change` | files: - | Confirmed, that overlap is still too tight. I’m widening the vertical spacing in the top-right UI cluster so update status sits cleanly below Update and above What’s Changed with no collision.
- L5083 | `change` | files: - | I’ve applied the spacing fix. I’ll push it now and trigger another release tag so you can update and confirm immediately.
- L5085 | `change` | files: - | PowerShell rejected chained &&; I’ll run push and tag as separate commands now.
- L5087 | `change` | files: - | Tag creation didn’t stick in that call; I’m creating it explicitly and pushing once more.
- L5089 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and pushed.
- L5093 | `change` | files: - | Update status moved lower.
- L5094 | `change` | files: - | “What’s Changed” moved further down.
- L5098 | `change` | files: - | Commit: bf9b61d
- L5099 | `change` | files: - | New release trigger tag: 2026.02.15.1140
- L5100 | `change` | files: - | Once Actions publishes this tag, update in-game and the overlap should be gone.
- L5103 | `change` | files: - | Nice catch. That None is coming from release body text being literally None/empty in the GitHub release metadata. I’ll fix this in two places: hide None in UI and make Actions always publish meaningful release notes text.
- L5105 | `change` | files: - | I’ve patched UI + release publishing notes. I’ll push this and trigger a new tag so you can verify the “What’s Changed” panel shows real content instead of None.
- L5107 | `change` | files: - | PowerShell separator issue again; running push and tag in separate commands now.
- L5109 | `change` | files: - | Tag push command used wrong ref format; I’ll push the tag via explicit refs/tags/... now.
- L5111 | `change` | files: - | Fixed.
- L5115 | `change` | files: - | UI handling for release notes:
- L5118 | `change` | files: - | Release workflow notes:
- L5119 | `change` | files: - | GitHub Actions now publishes each release with explicit body text.
- L5120 | `change` | files: - | Also enables generated release notes.
- L5123 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 81a416c
- L5124 | `change` | files: - | New release trigger tag: 2026.02.15.1145
- L5125 | `change` | files: - | After Actions finishes for 2026.02.15.1145, update in-game and open What’s Changed again. It should no longer show None.
- L5131 | `change` | files: - | Remove the You're up to date from top right alltogether, only bottom left " up to date " is needed, replace the " Whats changed"  closer to update and let the dropdown tekst box fit correctly into the screen
- L5133 | `change` | files: menu-scene.js | I’ll simplify that top-right cluster now: remove the top-right “You’re up to date” text entirely, move “What’s Changed” closer to the Update button, and constrain the dropdown panel so it always fits on-screen. I’m patching menu-scene.js directly.
- L5135 | `change` | files: - | I’m removing the top-right status text entirely and tightening the top-right layout: What’s Changed will sit directly under Update, and the dropdown panel will clamp to viewport width/height with safer margins. Applying patch now.
- L5137 | `change` | files: - | Patch is in. I’m pushing this layout cleanup and tagging a fresh release trigger so you can verify with an update immediately.
- L5141 | `change` | files: - | Implemented exactly what you asked:
- L5143 | `change` | files: - | Removed top-right update status text entirely.
- L5144 | `change` | files: - | Kept update status only in bottom-left.
- L5145 | `change` | files: - | Moved What's Changed closer to Update.
- L5149 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 4470f1f
- L5150 | `change` | files: - | Release trigger tag: 2026.02.15.1152
- L5151 | `change` | files: - | After Actions publishes this tag, update in-game and the top-right overlap/status clutter should be gone.
- L5157 | `change` | files: - | You’re right, and I found why: the 2026.02.15.1152 release was built from the previous commit, not the latest layout fix commit. I’m tagging a fresh release from the current head now so you get the actual UI changes.
- L5159 | `root-cause` | files: - | Confirmed root cause:
- L5162 | `change` | files: - | Tag 2026.02.15.1152 was on older commit: 81a416c
- L5163 | `change` | files: - | So your 1152 build didn’t include the spacing removal fix.
- L5165 | `change` | files: - | I pushed a new release tag from the correct commit:
- L5168 | `change` | files: - | Wait for Actions to publish 1156, then update in-game. That build includes:
- L5171 | `change` | files: - | What’s Changed moved closer to Update
- L5176 | `change` | files: - | Understood. I’m making the restart path more reliable now by hardening the updater helper launch and adding multi-step relaunch fallback in the helper script, so the game reopens after update even on picky Windows setups.
- L5178 | `change` | files: - | I also hardened restart reliability while editing: updater helper now has retries + relaunch fallbacks and writes to anime_platformer_updater.log for debugging. I’ll quickly validate syntax and then push both fixes.
- L5180 | `change` | files: - | I validated Python changes. I’m now committing only the restart reliability fix (excluding generated build-info noise), then tagging a new release so you can test both UI spacing and auto-restart on the correct build.
- L5182 | `change` | files: - | You were on an older release build before. I’ve now pushed a new release trigger from the latest fixes.
- L5184 | `change` | files: - | What’s included in the new tag 2026.02.15.1200:
- L5186 | `change` | files: - | Top-right status text removed (only bottom-left status remains).
- L5187 | `change` | files: - | What’s Changed button sits right under Update.
- L5189 | `change` | files: - | Update restart path hardened:
- L5193 | `change` | files: - | Please update to 2026.02.15.1200 and retest.
- L5200 | `change` | files: - | I see both issues in the screenshot. I’m fixing the changelog renderer to strip the auto-generated “Full Changelog” compare URL and hard-limit/wrap lines so the panel always fits cleanly on screen.
- L5202 | `change` | files: - | I’ve applied the formatting fix. I’m pushing it now and tagging a fresh release so you can verify in-game without the overflowing compare URL/1156 confusion.
- L5204 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and released.
- L5208 | `change` | files: - | Removed the auto-generated **Full Changelog** compare URL from the in-game panel.
- L5213 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 16c8841
- L5214 | `change` | files: - | New tag: 2026.02.15.1205
- L5215 | `change` | files: - | After Actions publishes 1205, update and re-open What’s Changed — it should be clean and fit correctly.
- L5219 | `change` | files: - | Wrapper still incorrect, auto restart doesn't work & game updated automatically, always let the user give the option to update
- L5223 | `change` | files: - | disable all automatic apply (user must press Update),
- L5224 | `change` | files: - | hard-remove Full Changelog/compare URL noise from the panel,
- L5226 | `change` | files: - | I’ll patch, push, and tag a fresh release for you to verify.
- L5227 | `change` | files: menu-scene.js | I’m applying a targeted fix now: disable automatic update apply (manual Update button only), and clean the “What’s Changed” parser/layout so compare links and overflow artifacts stop showing. I’ll patch menu-scene.js, then build and push a new release tag.
- L5229 | `root-cause` | files: - | I found the root cause in MenuScene: it still has auto-update logic and a permissive notes formatter. I’m patching those now so updates are only manual and the changelog panel is clean/fits correctly.
- L5233 | `change` | files: - | I’ve applied the menu-side fixes. Next I’ll build and publish a new EXE release so you can validate this exact behavior in-game (manual update only + cleaned changelog panel).
- L5235 | `change` | files: build-info.js | I found one extra modified file (build-info.js) from earlier build metadata; I’ll include it only if regenerated by this new build so versioning stays consistent. Now I’m running the standard build+publish flow.
- L5237 | `change` | files: - | I regenerated build metadata with your GitHub repo embedded (zyynx-hub/Platformer) so update checks won’t fall back to “service not configured.” I’ll now commit and push these fixes, then you can run your normal build/publish flow (or I can publish if you provide a token in env).
- L5239 | `change` | files: - | Code is pushed to main. I’m tagging this fix release now so your updater can see it as a new version from GitHub.
- L5241 | `change` | files: - | Implemented and pushed.
- L5245 | `change` | files: - | Manual update only (no auto-apply)
- L5246 | `change` | files: menu-scene.js | menu-scene.js: autoCheckUpdatesForBottomLeft() now only checks and shows Update found (...) Press Update.
- L5247 | `change` | files: - | It does not trigger update/restart automatically anymore.
- L5254 | `change` | files: - | Removed top-right status text
- L5255 | `change` | files: menu-scene.js | menu-scene.js: removed visible top-right “You’re up to date” line; bottom-left status remains the single source.
- L5256 | `change` | files: - | Build update source kept embedded
- L5257 | `change` | files: build-info.js | build-info.js: regenerated with repo zyynx-hub/Platformer.
- L5260 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 2f1cad7
- L5261 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1147
- L5262 | `change` | files: - | Branch: main updated on origin
- L5263 | `change` | files: desktop_launcher.py | If you want, next I can patch restart reliability further in desktop_launcher.py so after “Update + Restart” it hard-verifies relaunch and reports explicit success/failure in the debug panel.
- L5271 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and pushed.
- L5275 | `change` | files: updater.js | updater.js: updater now always falls back to default repo zyynx-hub/Platformer if build repo is missing.
- L5276 | `change` | files: - | Regenerated build info with repo embedded.
- L5278 | `change` | files: - | commit 61f07e6
- L5279 | `change` | files: - | tag 2026.02.15.1151
- L5285 | `change` | files: - | Download/run release 2026.02.15.1151 once from GitHub Releases.
- L5286 | `change` | files: - | After that, in-game update checks will use GitHub correctly (no “not configured” message).
- L5290 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | I’ll fetch the latest public release from your GitHub repo and download the EXE directly into your project root as AnimePlatformer.exe. Then I’ll confirm the exact version downloaded.
- L5292 | `change` | files: - | Done. Latest public release was downloaded directly to:
- L5295 | `change` | files: - | Release tag: 2026.02.15.1147
- L5300 | `change` | files: - | Game still doesn't auto restart after update
- L5306 | `change` | files: - | Patch compiled cleanly. I’m committing and tagging this fix so you can test update-restart behavior from a fresh release.
- L5308 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and shipped.
- L5312 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 1cb806e
- L5313 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1158
- L5317 | `change` | files: - | Added safer timing before app close so helper isn’t lost.
- L5322 | `change` | files: - | Added detailed helper logging for restart success/failure.
- L5323 | `change` | files: - | Please update to 2026.02.15.1158 and test again.
- L5347 | `change` | files: - | What to build:
- L5382 | `change` | files: - | this.latestReleaseNotes = "No update details yet.\n\nWorking on gameplay pressure, enemy behavior, and update reliability.";
- L5598 | `change` | files: - | Platformer.Debug.error("MenuScene.update", result.message || "Update failed.");
- L5605 | `change` | files: - | this.setBottomLeftUpdateStatus(opened ? "Downloading update..." : "Update download failed");
- L5613 | `change` | files: - | this.setBottomLeftUpdateStatus(result.message || "Can't reach update server.");
- L5623 | `change` | files: - | this.updateButtonText.setText(this.pendingUpdateUrl ? "Update + Restart" : "Update");
- L5629 | `change` | files: - | this.updateButtonText.setText("Update");
- L5638 | `change` | files: - | async startInAppUpdate(downloadUrl, startMessage = "Preparing update...") {
- L5657 | `change` | files: - | this.updateButtonText.setText("Update + Restart");
- L5658 | `change` | files: - | this.setBottomLeftUpdateStatus(result.message || "Update failed.");
- L5662 | `change` | files: - | this.setBottomLeftUpdateStatus(result.message || "Restarting to finish update...");
- L5703 | `change` | files: - | this.setBottomLeftUpdateStatus(result.message || "Can't reach update server.");

- L5716 | `change` | files: - | this.setBottomLeftUpdateStatus(`Update found (${v}). Press Update.`);
- L5719 | `change` | files: - | this.updateButtonText.setText("Update");
- L5850 | `change` | files: - | this.introLines.push(line);
- L6153 | `change` | files: - | If you want, I can now commit/push this and publish a new tagged EXE release so you can test it via updater too.
- L6156 | `change` | files: - | Always push so I can update
- L6158 | `intent` | files: - | Understood. I’m committing the cinematic intro changes now and pushing immediately so your updater can pick up a new version from GitHub.
- L6160 | `change` | files: menu-scene.js | I found one modified file (menu-scene.js). I’m pushing it now and tagging a new release version so it appears as an update.
- L6162 | `change` | files: - | Main is pushed. I’m creating and pushing tag 2026.02.15.1303 now so your release workflow can publish the new EXE for in-game updating.
- L6166 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 0f74fe3
- L6168 | `change` | files: - | Release tag: 2026.02.15.1303 pushed
- L6169 | `change` | files: - | From now on in this session, I’ll keep pushing changes immediately so you can update in-game.
- L6172 | `change` | files: - | Good catch. That message is from the helper script cleanup step, not the update copy itself. I’ll patch the updater to clean up silently (no “batch file cannot be found”), then push/tag so you can update immediately.
- L6174 | `change` | files: - | Patch is valid. I’m committing, pushing, and tagging now so it’s available via your update flow.
- L6176 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and pushed.
- L6178 | `change` | files: - | Commit: a639374
- L6179 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1308
- L6183 | `change` | files: - | Update to 2026.02.15.1308 and test again.
- L6188 | `change` | files: - | I’ll gate the cinematic so it plays only once per game boot (first main-menu load), skip it on all later returns, and reduce its duration. Then I’ll push/tag immediately.
- L6190 | `change` | files: - | Patch is in: intro now plays once per app boot and duration is cut roughly in half. I’m pushing/tagging now so you can update.
- L6194 | `change` | files: - | Commit: e34e0d1
- L6195 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1312
- L6204 | `change` | files: desktop_launcher.py | I’m going to fix restart at the source by changing the updater flow to launch a detached PowerShell helper (instead of relying on batch startup semantics), then keep a robust batch fallback. I’ll patch desktop_launcher.py, test syntax, and push/tag immediately.
- L6206 | `root-cause` | files: - | I’ve identified a likely root cause: the helper relaunch is too “single-shot.” I’m adding retry-based relaunch logic in the updater script plus Windows job breakaway flags when spawning the helper, then pushing a new tag for immediate update testing.
- L6210 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 129d348
- L6211 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1318
- L6220 | `change` | files: - | Update to 2026.02.15.1318 and test again.
- L6226 | `change` | files: - | I’ll shorten the intro further to a snappy ~1.8s and keep the same one-boot-only behavior, then push/tag right away.
- L6228 | `change` | files: - | I’ve pushed the shorter intro. Tagging a new release now so updater picks it up.
- L6232 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 3803dd9
- L6233 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1321
- L6269 | `change` | files: - | Then helper isn’t being launched reliably on your machine yet. I’m adding a guaranteed updater log path under your user profile (not just %TEMP%) and extra launcher-side logging so we always have traces, then I’ll push/tag immediately.
- L6271 | `change` | files: - | I added persistent updater logging under updater.log with fallback creation. I’m committing and tagging this now so you can update and immediately get logs even if restart fails.
- L6275 | `change` | files: - | Commit: db2447f
- L6276 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1328
- L6305 | `change` | files: - | That means the currently running EXE is likely an older build (before logging changes) or running from a different folder.
- L6310 | `change` | files: - | Run one update attempt.
- L6317 | `change` | files: - | I'm on 1328 but no update log
- L6319 | `change` | files: - | I’ll quickly scan your user profile for any updater.log/runtime-debug.log copies in alternate locations to confirm where this build is writing (or not writing).
- L6321 | `change` | files: - | I found your logs, but they’re being written to temp extraction folders (_MEI...) and %TEMP%, which explains why you couldn’t find them at the new path. I’m checking the latest entries now, then I’ll patch logging to one fixed location permanently.
- L6323 | `change` | files: - | I found your logs and they prove helper relaunch is being triggered. I’m now fixing log storage to a permanent single location (not _MEI temp) so it’s always easy to find, then I’ll push/tag.
- L6335 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 4f54c51
- L6336 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1336
- L6348 | `change` | files: - | Thanks, that log is useful: it confirms replacement succeeded and the relaunch command returned success, but not that the new process stayed alive. I’m patching the helper to relaunch with PID verification and retries, then I’ll push/tag immediately.
- L6350 | `change` | files: - | I fixed the helper script logic to avoid fragile single-shot launches and added verified PID-based relaunch retries. I’m pushing/tagging now.
- L6362 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 2ba1e7a
- L6363 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1344
- L6364 | `change` | files: - | Please update to 2026.02.15.1344 and test once.
- L6372 | `change` | files: - | I’ll upgrade the intro flow with staged menu entrance: after title reveal, Play/Continue/Options/Credits/Exit will slide up and fade in one-by-one with a clean stagger. Then I’ll push/tag immediately.
- L6374 | `change` | files: - | I’ve implemented the staggered button flow-in after title reveal. I’m committing and tagging this now so you can update directly.
- L6378 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 65ab150
- L6379 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1348
- L6390 | `change` | files: - | I’m going to remove the fragile restart loop that can hang the helper window, replace it with a simpler guaranteed relaunch sequence, and hide the helper console so you don’t get stuck on that black screen. Then I’ll push/tag immediately.
- L6394 | `change` | files: - | Patched and validated. I’m pushing/tagging this restart fix now so you can update to it right away.
- L6396 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and pushed a restart path rewrite.
- L6398 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 52320e5
- L6399 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1354
- L6402 | `change` | files: - | Removed the complex relaunch subroutine that could stall.
- L6408 | `change` | files: - | Update to 2026.02.15.1354 and test update+restart again.
- L6411 | `change` | files: IFFY_IDLE.png | I’ll fix this warning spam at the source: clean up the player-idle loader so it does one clear check, no repeated fallback URL attempts, and only logs once when IFFY_IDLE.png is missing. Then I’ll push/tag so you can update.
- L6415 | `change` | files: - | I removed the fallback loop and warning spam. I’ll commit/push/tag now so you can pull this as an update.
- L6417 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and pushed.

- L6420 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1400
- L6423 | `change` | files: - | Removed the repeated runtime fallback attempts for IFFY_IDLE.
- L6428 | `change` | files: - | The game still fails to reboot after update :(
- L6430 | `change` | files: - | I’m implementing a stronger relaunch strategy now: the helper will use a PowerShell retry loop that confirms the new process actually stays alive, then fallback to start/explorer only if that fails. After patch I’ll push/tag immediately.
- L6432 | `change` | files: - | Patch compiled cleanly. I’m pushing this restart fix as a new release tag now.
- L6436 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 5de1e47
- L6437 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1413
- L6442 | `change` | files: - | Update to 2026.02.15.1413 and test again.
- L6446 | `change` | files: - | Didnt commit
- L6448 | `change` | files: - | I’ll verify the local git state and recent commits/tags right now, then I’ll commit/push anything missing immediately.
- L6455 | `change` | files: - | latest tag: 2026.02.15.1413 -> 5de1e47
- L6458 | `change` | files: - | If you’re not seeing it in-game yet, your release workflow may not have published the EXE for 2026.02.15.1413 yet. I can push a fresh bump tag now to force a new release run.
- L6463 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | I’ll download the latest GitHub release EXE directly to your PC now and overwrite AnimePlatformer.exe.
- L6473 | `change` | files: - | I’ll redesign the main menu visuals directly in MenuScene with stronger color depth, glow accents, better button styling, and subtle motion so it feels polished without hurting performance. Then I’ll commit/push/tag for in-game update.
- L6475 | `change` | files: - | I’m applying a visual polish pass now: richer neon background layers, a glassy menu card, upgraded button styling with glow/hover animation, and a cleaner title treatment. Then I’ll push/tag for updater delivery.
- L6477 | `change` | files: - | I’ve applied the visual overhaul; I’m now committing and pushing a new tagged build so you can update immediately and see the polished menu.
- L6481 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 1bb5fe1
- L6482 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1428
- L6490 | `change` | files: - | Update/changelog widgets visually matched to new style
- L6491 | `change` | files: - | Update to 2026.02.15.1428 and check the new menu look.
- L6537 | `change` | files: - | Doesn't update the exe after update
- L6539 | `change` | files: - | Your log shows the helper starts repeatedly but stops mid-flow in newer runs. I’m replacing the helper from fragile .bat logic to a hidden PowerShell updater script with explicit retry/copy/relaunch handling. This should fix both “no restart” and “no real EXE swap” reliability. I’ll patch and push/tag now.
- L6541 | `change` | files: - | This log shows the real issue: many helper runs start, but most never reach replace ok, so they’re getting stuck before file replacement (likely waiting on/competing with a still-running process). I’m fixing the updater to wait on the exact current PID, force-kill if needed, and log every failure reason, then I’ll push/tag.
- L6549 | `change` | files: - | Commit: 4e50243
- L6550 | `change` | files: - | Tag: 2026.02.15.1438
- L6556 | `change` | files: - | Added retry diagnostics into updater log (backup retry ... failed, replace retry ... failed).
- L6558 | `change` | files: - | Update to 2026.02.15.1438 and test one update cycle.
- L6562 | `change` | files: - | Download all new files directly on pc, cant download from git cuase of current issue, hopefully fixed in new build
- L6564 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | I’ll sync your local project to latest main and also download the latest release AnimePlatformer.exe directly into C:\Users\Robin\Desktop\codex so you have everything locally without using in-game updater.
- L6566 | `change` | files: - | Latest published release is still 2026.02.15.1428 (GitHub hasn’t published 1438 release asset yet). I’ll build the newest EXE locally from current code (4e50243) and place it in your root folder now.
- L6568 | `change` | files: - | I downloaded the latest published release, and also built a local EXE from the newest source. I’m doing one quick rebuild with version override 2026.02.15.1438 so your in-game version matches the latest fix tag exactly.
- L6572 | `change` | files: - | What I updated locally:
- L6575 | `change` | files: - | Downloaded latest published release EXE:
- L6577 | `change` | files: - | Release tag: 2026.02.15.1428
- L6581 | `change` | files: - | You can launch that EXE now; it includes the latest updater fixes even before GitHub release asset catches up.
- L6586 | `change` | files: - | Issue: .spec file is in the repo but should be auto-generated. It causes merge conflicts and version bloat.
- L6587 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.spec | Fix: Remove AnimePlatformer.spec from git, add *.spec to .gitignore, regenerate it during every build.
- L6589 | `change` | files: - | 2. Hard-Coded Release Notes
- L6590 | `change` | files: release.yml | Issue: release.yml has boilerplate changelog that doesn't reflect actual changes.
- L6595 | `change` | files: - | Fix: Remove .bak files from dist before creating release, add script to clean old backups during uninstall.
- L6601 | `change` | files: - | 5. Fragile Update System with Too Many Fallbacks
- L6603 | `change` | files: - | Fix: Standardize on single update source (GitHub Releases API), fail cleanly instead of cascading fallbacks.
- L6607 | `change` | files: - | Fix: Generate SHA256 hash for each release, include in release notes, validate before executing update.
- L6610 | `change` | files: settings.js | Issue: settings.js:78-100 has no migration path when new settings are added.
- L6615 | `change` | files: - | Fix: Only initialize debug console if window.DEBUG_MODE flag is true, condition on build type.
- L6622 | `change` | files: release.yml | Issue: release.yml uses loose version pins (6.19.0), can break future builds.
- L6623 | `change` | files: requirements-build.txt | Fix: Pin exact versions: pyinstaller==6.19.0, pywebview==4.4.1, add requirements-build.txt to track.
- L6630 | `change` | files: - | Issue: assets folder referenced but no build step validates they exist or compresses them.
- L6631 | `change` | files: - | Fix: Add asset preprocessor: resize images, compress with imagemin, generate sprite atlas, validate in build.
- L6633 | `change` | files: - | 13. Update Still Checks Online Even When Disabled
- L6645 | `change` | files: - | 16. Build Info Generated But Not Validated
- L6646 | `change` | files: build-info.js, write_build_info.py | Issue: write_build_info.py:1-30 creates build-info.js but game doesn't validate it exists or is valid.
- L6651 | `change` | files: - | Fix: Generate source maps during build, store in separate GitHub release asset for debuggers.
- L6661 | `change` | files: - | 20. Update Dialog Doesn't Re-Check After Network Restored
- L6665 | `change` | files: - | I’ll apply this as a hardening pass in code, not just comments: I’ll first fix high-risk/runtime issues (URL validation, updater integrity, rollback safety, debug gating, settings migrations), then repository/build hygiene (.spec, .bak, pinned build deps, release notes). After edits I’ll commit and push/tag for updater delivery.
- L6667 | `change` | files: - | I’ve audited the codebase against your 20 points. I’m now implementing a concrete patch set across launcher/updater/settings/debug/build/release in one pass, then I’ll commit/push/tag.
- L6669 | `change` | files: - | I’m now applying the repo/build fixes (.spec, .bak, release notes, pinned deps, checksum asset generation, safer build script). After that I’ll patch launcher/updater/settings/debug/runtime behavior.
- L6671 | `change` | files: - | I’m continuing the hardening pass from your 20-point list and will finish the remaining critical fixes now, then run local validation before I report back. I’ll start by checking the current file state and completing rollback/update reliability first.
- L6675 | `change` | files: - | I found a key miss: rollback health checks were implemented but never called on startup, so failed updates can’t self-heal. I’m patching that and then finishing the remaining requested fixes (asset validation, level JSON loading, update-disabled guard, and release-note generation).
- L6679 | `change` | files: - | I’ve patched startup rollback activation. Next I’m adding build-time release note generation and asset/backup cleanup scripts, then wiring them into CI and local builds.
- L6687 | `change` | files: - | Implemented a major hardening pass across build, updater, settings, and level data.
- L6689 | `change` | files: - | Fixed now
- L6692 | `change` | files: publish_github_release.py, release.yml | Release notes: removed static boilerplate in CI and enabled generated notes (release.yml), plus commit-based body generation in local publisher (publish_github_release.py).
- L6693 | `change` | files: build_portable_exe.bat, cleanup_backups.py | Backup cleanup: build now deletes stale .bak files and runs cleanup script (build_portable_exe.bat, cleanup_backups.py).
- L6695 | `change` | files: desktop_launcher.py, updater.js | Updater fallback sprawl: standardized to GitHub-release flow, removed legacy/cascading behavior (updater.js, desktop_launcher.py).
- L6696 | `change` | files: desktop_launcher.py, publish_github_release.py, release.yml | Integrity check: updater now verifies SHA256 before applying (desktop_launcher.py), and build/release publishes .sha256 (release.yml, publish_github_release.py).
- L6697 | `change` | files: settings.js | Settings migration: schema versioning + migration + legacy cleanup added (settings.js).
- L6698 | `change` | files: debug.js, main.js, write_build_info.py | Debug console production gating: debug UI now only initializes when debug build flag is enabled (debug.js, main.js, write_build_info.py).
- L6699 | `change` | files: release.yml, requirements-build.txt | Build dep pinning: exact versions moved to requirements-build.txt, used by CI (requirements-build.txt, release.yml).
- L6700 | `change` | files: boot-scene.js, level-1.json, level-2.json, level-3.json, level-4.json, level-data.js | Level data decoupling: moved level definitions to JSON files loaded at runtime (level-1.json, level-2.json, level-3.json, level-4.json, boot-scene.js, level-data.js).
- L6701 | `change` | files: validate_assets.py | Asset validation: added build-time asset validator (validate_assets.py, wired in CI/local build).
- L6703 | `change` | files: desktop_launcher.py | Rollback health check: pending-update startup health monitor + rollback path now actually runs (desktop_launcher.py).
- L6705 | `change` | files: main.js | Build info validation: hard fail with clear error if build metadata missing (main.js).
- L6706 | `change` | files: build_portable_exe.bat | Build script safety: no unsafe Python resolution assumptions; %PYTHON%/py controlled usage (build_portable_exe.bat).
- L6707 | `change` | files: boot-scene.js, validate_assets.py | Missing asset degradation: optional asset warnings/fallback path preserved; criticals now validated pre-build (boot-scene.js, validate_assets.py).
- L6708 | `change` | files: main.js | Online retry: update re-check on reconnect wired (main.js).
- L6712 | `change` | files: - | Source maps (#17): added source-debug.zip release asset for production debugging, but not true JS sourcemap generation.
- L6715 | `change` | files: - | Python syntax checks passed for launcher/build scripts.
- L6725 | `change` | files: - | I’m tightening encapsulation one step further: I’ll remove the runtime window.Platformer global from the bundle path and keep internals scoped to the bundle namespace, while preserving source-map line fidelity.
- L6727 | `change` | files: - | Final pass is implemented.
- L6731 | `change` | files: - | Added real JS bundling + source maps:
- L6740 | `change` | files: - | Removed window.Platformer = ... from runtime bundle output (replaced during bundling), so window.Platformer is no longer the app-wide global entry point.
- L6742 | `change` | files: - | Switched runtime to bundle-only loading:
- L6746 | `change` | files: - | Wired bundle generation into build pipelines:
- L6747 | `change` | files: build_js_bundle.py, build_portable_exe.bat | Local build: build_portable_exe.bat now runs build_js_bundle.py.
- L6748 | `change` | files: build_js_bundle.py, release.yml | CI build: release.yml now runs build_js_bundle.py.
- L6763 | `change` | files: build_portable_exe.bat | Build/release as usual (build_portable_exe.bat)
- L6767 | `change` | files: - | Not yet from my side. I updated the code and build pipeline, but I haven’t launched the installer/build command on your machine in this step.
- L6773 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | This will regenerate bundle/map, build the EXE, and place AnimePlatformer.exe in the project root.
- L6778 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | I’m running the local build/install script now so your root AnimePlatformer.exe is updated with the latest final-pass changes.
- L6782 | `change` | files: - | Your local EXE has been rebuilt and replaced at:
- L6785 | `change` | files: - | Build also regenerated:
- L6789 | `change` | files: - | Note: the final line ERROR: Input redirection is not supported came from the batch pause in this non-interactive run, after build completion. The install itself succeeded.
- L6792 | `change` | files: - | From now on, only build locally as the commits are taking too long because of frequency.
- L6794 | `change` | files: - | After rebooting the game, settings like Music Volume are reset. Make sure all in-game settings are saved and restored upon boot.
- L6798 | `root-cause` | files: - | Found the root cause: settings save had a hard 1KB cap and silently replaced oversized settings with defaults, which resets audio/video values on reboot. I’m removing that cap and rebuilding locally.
- L6802 | `change` | files: - | I will keep it local-only from now on (no automatic commit/push flow).
- L6803 | `change` | files: settings.js | I fixed the settings reset bug by removing the hard size cap fallback that was overwriting settings with defaults in settings.js.
- L6804 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt locally and updated:
- L6811 | `change` | files: - | All settings are saved as-is and restored on boot.
- L6815 | `root-cause` | files: - | I found likely root cause for settings reset: EXE runs from a changing temp extraction path, so browser localStorage origin can change between boots. I’m adding persistent host-side settings storage in the Python launcher and wiring JS to read/write it, and I’ll re-enable debug panel for desktop builds.
- L6825 | `change` | files: - | Fixed both issues and rebuilt locally.
- L6830 | `change` | files: desktop_launcher.py | Added desktop-host persistent settings file support in desktop_launcher.py:
- L6834 | `change` | files: settings.js | Updated settings.js:
- L6835 | `change` | files: - | Added bootstrap() to load host-persisted settings on startup.
- L6837 | `change` | files: main.js | Updated main.js:
- L6839 | `change` | files: - | Debug menu restored
- L6840 | `change` | files: debug.js | Updated debug.js to enable debug panel automatically in desktop host mode (pywebview) even if build debug flag is off.
- L6842 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt and replaced:
- L6844 | `change` | files: - | Also acknowledged: from now on I’ll keep it local-only (no push/commit workflow unless you explicitly ask).
- L6857 | `change` | files: - | What I fixed
- L6860 | `change` | files: - | Added host-backed persistent settings file:
- L6865 | `change` | files: - | Debug menu restored
- L6867 | `change` | files: - | Installed build
- L6869 | `change` | files: - | Updated local EXE:
- L6887 | `change` | files: - | Checked and fixed with file-level verification.
- L6889 | `change` | files: - | All required files are present and wired
- L6903 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt + installed locally:
- L6904 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | AnimePlatformer.exe (latest build)
- L6926 | `change` | files: - | I dont like the terminal opening when game is booted, remove it, only game should boot
- L6928 | `change` | files: - | I’ll remove the console window by switching the EXE build to windowed mode, then rebuild locally so boot opens only the game window.
- L6930 | `change` | files: - | I also need CI/local parity, so I’m applying the same windowed flag in the workflow build command.
- L6934 | `change` | files: - | Done. I verified the full chain and patched a real timing bug.
- L6948 | `change` | files: settings.js | Added explicit bridge-ready wait in settings.js before host read/write.
- L6951 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt/install locally again:
- L6953 | `change` | files: runw.exe | Build now uses runw.exe (windowed, no terminal).
- L6968 | `change` | files: - | I patched the intro-resize behavior to safely complete intro and re-layout immediately when window size changes. I’ll rebuild locally now.
- L6970 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and installed.
- L6974 | `change` | files: - | Added resize handler that detects active intro and force-completes it safely.
- L6979 | `change` | files: - | Added cleanup for intro glow object to avoid stale visual state.
- L6980 | `change` | files: - | Updated EXE:
- L6995 | `change` | files: - | I’ve added the live mini-stage behavior and stomp effects in the menu scene. I’m now rebuilding locally so you can launch and verify right away.
- L6997 | `change` | files: - | Implemented. The main menu now has a visible “alive” mini-scene in the green area where the player character:
- L7003 | `change` | files: menu-scene.js | I updated this in menu-scene.js and rebuilt locally.
- L7007 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | AnimePlatformer.exe (updated)
- L7013 | `change` | files: - | new green area made somehow, its supossed to play in the already existing green area, remove newly made green area and limit to the the existing green area
- L7015 | `change` | files: - | I’ll align the mini animation strip to the existing menu green band and remove the extra painted strip so no new green area is drawn. Then I’ll rebuild locally.
- L7017 | `change` | files: - | Done. I removed the extra visual strip and constrained the mini character/enemy animation to the existing green menu band only.
- L7026 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | AnimePlatformer.exe (updated, version 2026.02.15.1502)
- L7040 | `change` | files: menu-scene.js | Updated menu-scene.js (updateMenuMiniStage) with side-hit detection + damage cooldown + red blink timer.
- L7041 | `change` | files: - | Local build updated:
- L7052 | `change` | files: - | I’ve patched both scenes. I’m rebuilding now so you can verify: runner state should persist across Options->Menu, and Options now uses a transparent menu-style animated background.
- L7060 | `change` | files: - | State is saved continuously during menu update and on scene shutdown.
- L7061 | `change` | files: - | State is restored when menu mini-stage is created again.
- L7067 | `change` | files: - | Added subtle animated orbs/lines, with transparent alpha so it feels like the same style.
- L7068 | `change` | files: - | Added resize handling for this backdrop.
- L7072 | `change` | files: - | Local build updated:
- L7075 | `change` | files: - | Build version: 2026.02.15.1512
- L7081 | `change` | files: - | Patched. I’m rebuilding now; after this, opening Options from main menu will keep the menu scene alive and animated underneath.
- L7083 | `change` | files: - | Fixed.
- L7092 | `change` | files: - | Menu interaction is disabled while Options is open, then restored on back/ESC.
- L7093 | `change` | files: - | returnTo: "menuOverlay" flow added in OptionsScene.goBack().
- L7098 | `change` | files: - | Local build updated:
- L7111 | `change` | files: - | Updated:
- L7118 | `change` | files: - | Local build installed:
- L7128 | `change` | files: - | I’ve patched the resize/layout path and menu-overlay visibility. I’m rebuilding now; this should keep Options centered and prevent the menu buttons from showing through.
- L7130 | `change` | files: - | Fixed.
- L7134 | `change` | files: - | Added full resize relayout in Options:
- L7139 | `change` | files: - | Files updated:
- L7143 | `change` | files: - | Local build updated:
- L7154 | `change` | files: - | Confirmed and fixed again with a stricter resize-safe layout.
- L7162 | `change` | files: - | Menu UI remains hidden while overlay is open, restored on exit.
- L7167 | `change` | files: - | Local build updated:
- L7192 | `change` | files: - | Local build updated:
- L7201 | `change` | files: - | Fixed. Scrolling is restored.
- L7203 | `root-cause` | files: - | Root cause was the sticky-footer refactor without a fixed container height for the scroll region.
- L7206 | `change` | files: - | Updated:
- L7209 | `change` | files: - | Local build updated:
- L7216 | `change` | files: - | I’m going to directly inspect the current Options DOM/CSS and input handling to remove the scroll blocker at the source. Then I’ll patch with the most reliable approach (single scroll container + fixed sticky footer overlay).
- L7220 | `change` | files: - | Fixed with a hard scroll override.
- L7224 | `change` | files: - | Added explicit wheel handler on the Options scroll container (.opt-scroll) with passive: false.
- L7230 | `change` | files: - | Local build updated:
- L7241 | `change` | files: - | Good catch. I’ll remove the sticky overlay behavior and make the footer a fixed non-overlapping row under a dedicated scroll area, so the scrollbar and last settings lines stay fully visible. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L7243 | `change` | files: - | I’ve removed the sticky overlap logic; now the footer is separate from the scroll viewport. Rebuilding now so you can re-test the bottom of the Updates section and scrollbar.
- L7245 | `change` | files: - | Fixed.
- L7247 | `change` | files: - | I removed the overlapping behavior:
- L7249 | `change` | files: - | Save + Back / Reset defaults footer is now a normal fixed row under the scroll area (not sticky overlay).
- L7253 | `change` | files: - | Updated file:
- L7256 | `change` | files: - | Local build installed:
- L7265 | `change` | files: - | Fixed. The footer buttons are now anchored and visible again, without covering the bottom settings rows.
- L7272 | `change` | files: - | Updated:
- L7275 | `change` | files: - | Local build updated:
- L7280 | `change` | files: - | Great, main menu looks clean and dont know any other updates. Update it to git, make sure updating still works in main game and also make sure to note every new element added in whats changed since last git push
- L7282 | `change` | files: - | I’ll do this in three steps: verify updater paths still intact, prepare a commit with a complete “what changed” summary, then push to origin so your in-game update pipeline can pick it up. I’m checking git/workflow state first.
- L7284 | `change` | files: - | I’m adding a clear built-in “What’s Changed” summary in the menu fallback text (for cases where release notes aren’t fetched yet), then I’ll commit all current work and push to main.
- L7286 | `change` | files: - | Build and asset validation passed locally. I’m now committing all current changes with a detailed changelog-style message (so GitHub/release notes capture everything), then pushing to main.
- L7288 | `change` | files: - | Push is complete. I’m doing one final local rebuild with UPDATE_GH_REPO=zyynx-hub/Platformer so your installed EXE is update-enabled against GitHub immediately.
- L7290 | `change` | files: - | I finished a final rebuild with GitHub repo auto-update enabled, which changed generated files (build-info + bundle). I’m pushing this final generated-state commit too, so git matches the update-enabled local build.
- L7292 | `change` | files: - | Done. Everything is pushed to GitHub and update flow remains wired.
- L7297 | `change` | files: - | 1740970 chore: refresh generated bundle and build-info (repo-linked updater)
- L7300 | `change` | files: - | Local build + asset validation passed.
- L7301 | `change` | files: - | EXE rebuilt with updater source configured to zyynx-hub/Platformer.
- L7302 | `change` | files: - | Main menu “What’s Changed” fallback now includes all newly added elements since last push, so users still see meaningful notes even if remote release notes are unavailable.
- L7303 | `change` | files: - | Local updated EXE:
- L7306 | `change` | files: - | Build version: 2026.02.15.1537
- L7311 | `change` | files: - | You’re right, that panel is still showing the latest public release notes instead of your installed local build (1537). I’m patching it so when GitHub notes are older than your current build, it shows local current-build notes instead.
- L7313 | `change` | files: - | Patch is in. I’m rebuilding now so 1537+ shows local build notes when remote release notes are older.
- L7315 | `change` | files: - | Exactly. In 1537, it was still showing the last public release (1438) because GitHub release notes were older than your local build.
- L7317 | `change` | files: - | Fixed now:
- L7319 | `change` | files: - | If remote release version is older than installed build, the panel shows local current-build notes instead.
- L7320 | `change` | files: - | So for local builds like 1537+, “What’s Changed” will reflect your latest local features, not stale release notes.
- L7321 | `change` | files: - | New local build:
- L7325 | `change` | files: - | If you want, I can push this exact 1540 fix to GitHub now too.
- L7328 | `change` | files: - | Yes please, push it
- L7330 | `change` | files: - | I’ll commit the 1540 “What’s Changed” version-selection fix and push it to main now.
- L7334 | `change` | files: - | Commit:
- L7336 | `change` | files: - | da38982 fix: prefer local build notes when remote release notes are older
- L7342 | `change` | files: build-info.js | build-info.js
- L7343 | `change` | files: - | Your repo main is now updated with the 1540 “What’s Changed” fix.
- L7352 | `change` | files: - | - Tutorial text should be moved into an optional “Info” panel or shown the first time a level is selected (not blocking the map)
- L7360 | `change` | files: - | - If there’s already a tutorial system, refactor it to be triggered from the WorldMap (first-time per level) or via an “Info” button.
- L7364 | `change` | files: - | - Camera: top-down, smooth follow OR fixed camera (choose the simpler option for the current project)
- L7424 | `change` | files: - | I’ve located the current flow and I’m now implementing the world map end-to-end: new modular map components, Play button routing, progress unlock persistence, and return-from-level behavior. I’ll patch files now and then run a local bundle/build validation before sharing diffs and the new file list.
- L7430 | `change` | files: - | I’ve added the new world map modules and scene file. Next I’m wiring existing scenes: MenuScene Play route, GameScene completion/unlock emit, UIScene return-to-map, and bundle order/main scene registration.
- L7432 | `change` | files: - | I finished the wiring and I’m running the JS bundle build plus a quick syntax/consistency check now, then I’ll share exact diffs and file list.
- L7444 | `change` | files: - | Implemented
- L7446 | `change` | files: - | Added a modular world map system:
- L7447 | `change` | files: - | New WorldMapScene (top-down, fixed camera, smooth movement, blocked-region collisions, node graph with 5 nodes).
- L7459 | `change` | files: - | Tutorial refactor:
- L7460 | `change` | files: - | Blocking tutorial removed from Play path.
- L7504 | `change` | files: - | New files created
- L7515 | `change` | files: - | Build/validation run
- L7526 | `change` | files: - | Fresh local build completed and installed to root:
- L7528 | `change` | files: - | Build version updated to:
- L7540 | `change` | files: - | I’ll fix this by hardening resize sync again at the engine layer and forcing active scenes to relayout immediately after every resize/fullscreen transition, so UI hitboxes and visuals stay aligned. I’m patching now.
- L7542 | `change` | files: - | I’m hardening resize handling in two places: the JS runtime will now force relayout for active scenes after each resize, and the desktop host will emit staged resize events after fullscreen toggles. I’ll also lock desktop render resolution to pixel-perfect 1 to avoid blurry/interpolated UI on window size changes.
- L7544 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | I’ve patched the runtime and launcher; next I’m rebuilding and replacing your local AnimePlatformer.exe so you can verify resize behavior immediately.
- L7546 | `change` | files: - | Fixed locally and rebuilt.
- L7551 | `change` | files: - | Desktop now uses fixed render resolution 1 (prevents blurry scaling artifacts).
- L7552 | `change` | files: - | Added forced relayout pass after each resize for active scenes (ui.resize).
- L7556 | `change` | files: - | Installed build:
- L7558 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | AnimePlatformer.exe updated in root
- L7576 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and installed locally.
- L7578 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Root EXE updated: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L7579 | `change` | files: - | New build: 2026.02.15.1601
- L7591 | `root-cause` | files: - | I found the root cause: the world map is drawn in a large fixed world space, but resize can make the visible viewport crop/offset that space. I’m fixing it by fitting the map to the camera on every resize and pinning all map UI with scrollFactor(0) so it stays correctly anchored.
- L7593 | `change` | files: - | Confirmed and fixed with a stricter resize-safe map layout.
- L7632 | `change` | files: - | I patched the background behavior; now I’m rebuilding and replacing your local EXE so you can verify immediately.
- L7634 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and installed locally.
- L7636 | `root-cause` | files: - | Root cause was exactly what your screenshot showed: map camera zoom + world-space background caused exposed clear-color margins in level selection.
- L7641 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt and replaced root EXE.
- L7655 | `change` | files: - | Patched and installed locally.
- L7659 | `change` | files: - | Removed manual camera viewport override in WorldMapScene (setViewport(...)) because it was causing level-selection-only render area mismatch after resize.
- L7660 | `change` | files: - | Installed build:
- L7680 | `change` | files: - | Installed build:
- L7694 | `change` | files: - | Implemented and installed another hardening pass specifically for level selection.
- L7705 | `change` | files: - | Please test level selection resize again on this build.
- L7706 | `change` | files: - | If it still fails, send one screenshot from 1646 and I’ll lock this by disabling world-map scaling entirely and using fixed map pixels + letterbox (guaranteed stable).
- L7729 | `change` | files: - | Good catch. I fixed the crash path from your stack trace and installed a new local build.
- L7733 | `change` | files: main.js | Removed risky forced scene resize event emission in global resize sync (main.js).
- L7734 | `change` | files: - | Added null guards in MenuScene.layoutMenu() so resize during scene transitions can’t call setSize on destroyed objects.
- L7744 | `change` | files: - | If level-selection still misbehaves, send one screenshot + one new error block (if any), and I’ll do the final lock (fixed map viewport + letterbox only in WorldMap scene).
- L7767 | `change` | files: - | I’ve patched the crash path. I’ll rebuild/install locally now so you can retest the exact failing sequence immediately.
- L7769 | `change` | files: - | Crash fixed from your latest report and installed locally.
- L7771 | `change` | files: - | New build: 2026.02.15.1650
- L7772 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | EXE updated: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L7773 | `change` | files: - | What I fixed:
- L7778 | `change` | files: - | removed previously risky global forced scene-resize emit path
- L7801 | `change` | files: - | Patched from your exact crash report and installed locally.
- L7803 | `change` | files: - | New build: 2026.02.15.1652
- L7805 | `change` | files: - | What I fixed:
- L7809 | `change` | files: - | Added active-scene guards around world-map resize/layout paths.
- L7810 | `change` | files: - | Run this build and retry the previous resize sequence. If any crash remains, send the next error block and I’ll continue at that exact callsite.
- L7821 | `change` | files: - | Installed build:
- L7827 | `change` | files: - | Refactor the current level-selection “blue debug map” into a scalable, data-driven World Map system with:
- L7854 | `change` | files: - | SPRINT 0 — Recon + plan (NO REFACTOR YET)
- L7857 | `change` | files: - | - [ ] Document current flow and integration point (where map is entered/updated)
- L7956 | `change` | files: - | Starting SPRINT 0 only: I’ll identify the current level-selection implementation, map-entry integration point, and level-launch path from code, then report target files and flow notes with no refactor changes yet.
- L7958 | `change` | files: - | Starting SPRINT 0 now. I’ll only do recon: identify current level-selection render/input/data files, map entry flow, and exact level launch path, with no refactor changes yet.
- L7967 | `change` | files: - | Document current flow and integration point (where map is entered/updated)
- L7969 | `change` | files: - | Current implementation notes (no refactor yet):
- L8037 | `change` | files: - | I’ve patched bundle order to include the new manager. Next I’m adding the tutorial-world JSON structure and docs, then wiring a warm-load call in BootScene.
- L8073 | `change` | files: WorldMapManager.js | Added WorldMapManager.js to bundle order.
- L8075 | `change` | files: - | Added non-blocking warmup call:
- L8092 | `change` | files: - | Bundle build: passed.
- L8126 | `change` | files: - | Added new default path: data-driven static world map when DEBUG_WORLD_MAP === false.
- L8127 | `change` | files: - | Added createDataDrivenWorldStatic() flow using WorldMapManager.
- L8128 | `change` | files: - | Wired WorldMapView rendering and resize.
- L8131 | `change` | files: - | Added robust fallback using embedded tutorial-world data if JSON fetch fails.
- L8133 | `change` | files: - | Added Platformer.DEBUG_WORLD_MAP = false (new system default).
- L8135 | `change` | files: WorldMapView.js | Added WorldMapView.js to bundle order.
- L8141 | `change` | files: - | Build JS bundle:
- L8168 | `change` | files: - | You were right: code had changed, but your running build likely wasn’t updated.
- L8170 | `change` | files: - | I rebuilt and installed locally just now:
- L8173 | `change` | files: - | New build version: 2026.02.15.1734
- L8181 | `change` | files: - | EXE rebuilt and copied to root.
- L8217 | `change` | files: - | Added graph traversal state for data-driven map:
- L8219 | `change` | files: - | Added graph build + traversal methods:
- L8230 | `change` | files: - | Data-driven update path now:
- L8238 | `change` | files: - | Added traversal visual APIs:
- L8279 | `intent` | files: - | Understood. I’ll rebuild the local EXE at the end of every sprint from now on. I’m building the current Sprint 3 state now so your local game is up to date.
- L8283 | `change` | files: - | Current local install is updated:
- L8286 | `change` | files: - | Build version: 2026.02.15.1740
- L8290 | `intent` | files: - | Understood. I’ll change map traversal to instant directional movement (no E confirm), and make path lines much more visible so walkable connections are obvious. Then I’ll rebuild the EXE locally.
- L8294 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and rebuilt locally.
- L8301 | `change` | files: - | Local EXE updated:
- L8317 | `change` | files: - | Implemented and rebuilt.
- L8322 | `change` | files: - | Added defensive error logging (try/catch) around world-map render stages.
- L8323 | `change` | files: - | Added explicit diagnostics:
- L8326 | `change` | files: - | Added safer resize execution via guarded safeRun.
- L8327 | `change` | files: - | Local EXE updated:
- L8335 | `root-cause` | files: - | That will give exact root cause immediately.
- L8338 | `root-cause` | files: - | Perfect debug capture. Root cause found: drawPaths() was running before node index initialization, so every edge lookup returned null. I’m fixing the render order/indexing now and rebuilding the EXE.
- L8342 | `root-cause` | files: - | Root cause fixed:
- L8367 | `change` | files: - | I’ve added persistence and launch hooks; now I’m finishing state visuals for completed nodes and running a full build/rebundle to validate Sprint 4 end-to-end.
- L8369 | `change` | files: - | I’ve finished Sprint 4 logic changes and a small fix to completion routing by worldId. I’m rebuilding now and installing the updated EXE locally.
- L8386 | `change` | files: - | Added world-specific persisted progress (data.worlds[worldId]):
- L8388 | `change` | files: - | Added methods:
- L8397 | `change` | files: - | Added helpers:
- L8403 | `change` | files: - | Added setNodeState(nodeId, state) for runtime state visuals.
- L8407 | `change` | files: - | Added world-progress application into node state (applyWorldProgressToNodes).
- L8417 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt:
- L8424 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Launch AnimePlatformer.exe (build 2026.02.15.1756).
- L8442 | `change` | files: - | Bundle build succeeded.
- L8443 | `change` | files: - | Local EXE rebuilt and installed successfully:
- L8456 | `change` | files: - | Fixed both issues and rebuilt locally.
- L8462 | `change` | files: - | Added world unlock propagation so if Route Split is unlocked and unlock conditions are satisfied, both branches (teach_jump, shop_01) unlock automatically.
- L8464 | `change` | files: - | Added debug logs: Progress.world: Auto-unlocked ...
- L8467 | `change` | files: - | Added hard stop for gameplay music when leaving completed level back to world map.
- L8469 | `change` | files: - | Added debug log: UIScene.audio: Stopping gameplay music for scene transition.
- L8470 | `change` | files: - | Local EXE rebuilt:
- L8482 | `intent` | files: - | Understood. I’ll add explicit audio lifecycle logging and restore world-map background music intentionally (instead of silence) when returning from gameplay. Then I’ll rebuild locally.
- L8494 | `change` | files: - | I’ve patched audio startup diagnostics and retry logic in menu/world map. I’m rebuilding the bundle and local EXE now so you can test immediately without pulling from Git.
- L8496 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | I fixed and rebuilt locally. New EXE is ready at AnimePlatformer.exe (build 2026.02.15.1810).
- L8500 | `change` | files: - | Added full audio diagnostics in menu + world map
- L8511 | `change` | files: - | Added stronger fallback behavior
- L8516 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt bundle + local EXE
- L8530 | `change` | files: - | I’ll remove automatic node movement in world selection so the avatar never moves by itself, then rebuild the local EXE so you can test immediately.
- L8532 | `change` | files: - | Done. I removed auto-walk from world map entry so movement is now fully player-driven.
- L8537 | `change` | files: - | Removed automatic tryStartAutoWalk() call on initial node setup.
- L8538 | `change` | files: - | Removed automatic tryStartAutoWalk() call after arriving on nodes.
- L8539 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt locally:
- L8549 | `change` | files: - | I’ll remove junction auto-unlock side effects and enforce edge unlock rules so Route Split is traversable but doesn’t unlock branches until prerequisite level completion. Then I’ll rebuild your local EXE.
- L8551 | `root-cause` | files: - | I found the root cause: old junction auto-unlock plus saved unlock state persistence. I’m now removing junction auto-unlock entirely and enforcing unlocks from rules on every load, so previously over-unlocked branches get corrected. Then I’ll rebuild EXE.
- L8553 | `change` | files: - | Implemented and rebuilt locally.
- L8557 | `change` | files: - | Removed the junction auto-unlock behavior
- L8567 | `change` | files: - | Added debug logs for blocked movement
- L8571 | `change` | files: - | Local build:
- L8598 | `change` | files: - | Minimal persisted playerStats created (no existing upgrade system to wire into yet)
- L8601 | `change` | files: - | Added shop loader + cache:
- L8604 | `change` | files: - | Added persistent shop/progression fields + purchase API:
- L8609 | `change` | files: - | Added dedicated shop UI component:
- L8612 | `change` | files: - | Wired shop flow into world map:
- L8617 | `change` | files: - | Added shop-specific prompt text + logs
- L8618 | `change` | files: - | Bundle order updated:
- L8632 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt bundle and EXE successfully.
- L8633 | `change` | files: - | Local build version: 2026.02.15.1854
- L8634 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | EXE updated at: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L8640 | `change` | files: - | Proceeding with Sprint 6 now. I’ll implement real theme-layer rendering/parallax in the world map view, remove the empty-grid feel, and update documentation/placeholders, then rebuild locally.
- L8644 | `change` | files: - | I’ve completed the Sprint 6 code changes; now rebuilding your local EXE and validating the new theming/parallax hooks are in the bundled build.
- L8652 | `change` | files: - | Added placeholder backgrounds and wired config references
- L8654 | `change` | files: - | Removed “empty blue grid” look with layered background styling
- L8657 | `change` | files: - | Updated world map renderer for themed/parallax backgrounds:
- L8659 | `change` | files: - | Added backgroundLayers rendering using tileSprite
- L8660 | `change` | files: - | Added animated parallax motion via updateAmbient()
- L8661 | `change` | files: world.config.json | Added themed color parsing from world.config.json
- L8664 | `change` | files: - | Added logging for layer load success/fallback (WorldMapView.theme)
- L8665 | `change` | files: - | Wired ambient update loop:
- L8668 | `change` | files: - | Updated world tutorial config to use real placeholder assets:
- L8670 | `change` | files: - | Switched background layer sources to SVG placeholders
- L8671 | `change` | files: - | Added placeholder background assets:
- L8675 | `change` | files: - | Updated docs:
- L8690 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt JS bundle and local EXE successfully.
- L8691 | `change` | files: - | Current local build: 2026.02.15.1901
- L8692 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | EXE updated at: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L8699 | `change` | files: - | Agreed, it looked too flat/stripy. I restyled it and rebuilt locally.
- L8704 | `change` | files: - | Removed heavy horizontal strip look.
- L8705 | `change` | files: - | Added subtle nebula/orb + diagonal ambient streaks.
- L8708 | `change` | files: world.config.json | Updated theme colors in world.config.json.
- L8709 | `change` | files: - | Files updated:
- L8722 | `change` | files: - | All requested sprints (0 through 6) are now implemented.
- L8738 | `change` | files: - | Sprint 10 — Save/Load Hardening
- L8746 | `change` | files: - | Sprint 12 — Packaging Release Pass
- L8748 | `change` | files: - | One-click local release build
- L8749 | `change` | files: - | Release-candidate checklist + signoff
- L8759 | `change` | files: - | I pushed a visual cleanup pass and rebuilt locally.
- L8761 | `change` | files: - | Updated:
- L8764 | `change` | files: - | Added soft orb lighting layers (subtle movement)
- L8765 | `change` | files: - | Added node-type badges inside nodes (S, T, +, $, B, L) for clarity
- L8770 | `change` | files: - | Local EXE rebuilt:
- L8794 | `change` | files: - | Patch is in. I’m running a local rebuild now so you can launch the updated EXE immediately and verify settings live-apply + persistence.
- L8796 | `change` | files: - | I’ve rebuilt locally with the fix (Version 2026.02.15.1959). Next step is your quick verify: change Music volume in Options, hit Save+Back, and check debug lines OptionsScene.settings, MenuScene.settings, WorldMap.settings, or GameScene.settings immediately.
- L8798 | `change` | files: - | Implemented and rebuilt locally. Settings now apply at runtime again.
- L8802 | `change` | files: - | Added live settings listeners and handlers in:
- L8806 | `change` | files: - | Added defensive try/catch + debug logs for all runtime settings-apply paths.
- L8807 | `change` | files: game-scene.js | Updated applyVideoSettings in game-scene.js to update the existing brightness overlay instead of stacking new overlays.
- L8813 | `change` | files: - | Local build
- L8814 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt EXE successfully.
- L8815 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Updated root executable: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L8816 | `change` | files: - | Build version: 2026.02.15.1959
- L8837 | `change` | files: - | Added get_primary_monitor_resolution() using Windows system metrics.
- L8842 | `change` | files: - | Added startup log line with chosen resolution.
- L8843 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt locally
- L8844 | `change` | files: - | New local EXE built and updated:
- L8846 | `change` | files: - | Build version: 2026.02.15.2003
- L8858 | `change` | files: - | Done. I fixed both points and rebuilt locally.
- L8861 | `change` | files: - | Added a real display mode option in Settings:
- L8884 | `change` | files: - | I added crash-safe handling for Options and forced error logging into debug console. Rebuilding now to verify no syntax/runtime regressions.
- L8886 | `change` | files: - | I added recovery + hard logging for Options initialization failures. I’m rebuilding now so the debug panel can capture the actual error instead of leaving a blank overlay.
- L8888 | `change` | files: - | Patched and rebuilt.
- L8891 | `change` | files: - | Added robust recovery when opening Options from Menu:
- L8892 | `change` | files: - | If OptionsScene fails to launch, menu UI is restored automatically.
- L8894 | `change` | files: - | Added hard try/catch around OptionsScene.create():
- L8897 | `change` | files: - | Build
- L8898 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Updated local EXE: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L8913 | `change` | files: - | I’ve switched Options launch to a ready/failed handshake so first-click blank should be gone and failures always log. Rebuilding now.
- L8915 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and rebuilt.
- L8925 | `change` | files: - | Added explicit debug logs:
- L8931 | `change` | files: - | Local build
- L8932 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Updated EXE: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L8939 | `change` | files: - | I’ve added an explicit post-ready visibility/scene-top pass and logging. Rebuilding now so you can retest first-click Options.
- L8945 | `change` | files: - | Included in build 2026.02.15.2111
- L8948 | `change` | files: - | emits options-ready only when UI is fully created
- L8952 | `change` | files: - | Updated local EXE
- L8970 | `change` | files: - | I’ve applied both fixes and added DOM rect logging for first-open Options. Rebuilding now.
- L8972 | `change` | files: - | Applied and rebuilt.
- L8979 | `change` | files: - | Added stronger Options DOM visibility forcing and first-frame DOM rect logs.
- L8980 | `change` | files: - | Updated EXE
- L8992 | `change` | files: - | I see it clearly: Options scene is active (title/back render), but the HTML options panel isn’t being painted. I’m removing the fragile overlay DOM path: Options will open as its own scene and mount the settings panel directly to document.body (fixed overlay), which avoids this Phaser DOM layering bug entirely. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L8994 | `change` | files: - | I replaced the Options overlay DOM path with a fixed body-mounted panel and switched menu -> options to dedicated scene mode. Rebuilding now.
- L8996 | `change` | files: - | Fixed with a hard approach and rebuilt.
- L9000 | `change` | files: - | Options UI panel is no longer Phaser-DOM-managed; it is mounted directly to document.body as a fixed overlay.
- L9001 | `change` | files: - | Removed the fragile menuOverlay dependency path for main-menu options.
- L9006 | `change` | files: - | New local build
- L9014 | `intent` | files: - | Got it. That means first-render timing is still flaky. I’m adding a hard “first-frame DOM recovery” in Options: it will re-mount/reposition/force-visible for the first second, so it shows immediately without needing ESC or any interaction. Then I’ll rebuild locally.
- L9016 | `change` | files: - | I added a first-second DOM recovery loop so Options should appear immediately on first open. Rebuilding now.
- L9018 | `change` | files: - | Implemented and rebuilt.
- L9021 | `change` | files: - | Added hard first-second recovery for Options DOM:
- L9026 | `change` | files: - | Added OptionsScene.dom debug line with rect info.
- L9027 | `change` | files: - | New local build
- L9036 | `root-cause` | files: - | I’m targeting the root cause as viewport mismatch on first boot: UI DOM is likely being positioned using stale Phaser sizes until an ESC-triggered relayout. I’m patching Options to use real window viewport (innerWidth/innerHeight) for DOM layout and adding an initial forced relayout pulse at startup.
- L9038 | `change` | files: - | I patched viewport-based DOM placement plus startup relayout pulses. Rebuilding now so first-open Options should render without pressing ESC.
- L9044 | `change` | files: main.js | Added startup resize pulses in main.js (60/180/420/900ms) so wrappers with stale first frame relayout immediately.
- L9049 | `change` | files: - | This should remove the “only appears after ESC” issue. If not, send one more screenshot plus the single OptionsScene.dom line from debug; with that line I can hard-lock exact coordinates for your monitor profile.
- L9056 | `change` | files: - | I added native window-size polling and relayout during Options startup. Rebuilding now so first-open should render immediately in fullscreen too.
- L9058 | `change` | files: - | Applied another fix and rebuilt.
- L9073 | `root-cause` | files: - | I found the likely root cause: desktop build is forcing fullscreen twice (native wrapper + browser fullscreen API). That can leave DOM/UI in a bad pre-resize state until ESC. I’m disabling browser fullscreen for desktop host and letting native mode be the only fullscreen authority.
- L9075 | `change` | files: - | I patched both conflict points (browser fullscreen disabled in desktop host + delayed native fullscreen apply). Rebuilding now.
- L9077 | `change` | files: - | Found and fixed the likely root problem.
- L9079 | `root-cause` | files: - | Root cause targeted
- L9080 | `change` | files: - | Desktop build was trying fullscreen in two layers:
- L9094 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt
- L9097 | `change` | files: - | Test this build first.
- L9105 | `change` | files: - | I’ll lock the three display modes to fixed resolutions in the desktop wrapper exactly as you requested, then rebuild locally: fullscreen 1960x1080, border-mode 1960x1080 with window borders, windowed 1377x727.
- L9109 | `change` | files: - | Implemented exactly as requested and rebuilt.
- L9112 | `change` | files: - | Fullscreen: fixed to 1960 x 1080
- L9113 | `change` | files: - | Borderless option: fixed to 1960 x 1080 with window borders (per your instruction)
- L9114 | `change` | files: - | Windowed: fixed to 1377 x 727
- L9115 | `change` | files: - | Local build
- L9136 | `change` | files: - | Great error report. I’ll patch this as an async-after-destroy bug in MenuScene update status text, add lifecycle guards around those async update callbacks, then rebuild locally.
- L9138 | `change` | files: - | I found the exact crash point: async updater callback is trying to write text after the Menu scene/text texture is gone. I’m adding scene/object liveness guards and safe text setters around all update status writes.
- L9140 | `change` | files: - | I’m fixing the crash from your pasted stack now. I’ll patch the bottom-left update text flow so async update checks cannot write to destroyed Phaser text objects, then rebuild locally and give you the new EXE.
- L9142 | `change` | files: - | I found the update-status text path already partially guarded, but I’m adding a stronger fallback now: automatic text-object rebuild on failure so the WebGL text canvas null case cannot crash during async update checks. Then I’ll rebuild the EXE.
- L9144 | `change` | files: - | Patched and rebuilt locally.
- L9146 | `change` | files: - | What I fixed for this crash:
- L9148 | `change` | files: - | Hardened MenuScene bottom-left update text updates so async updater callbacks cannot call setText on stale/destroyed Phaser text objects.
- L9149 | `change` | files: - | Added ensureVersionInfoText() to recreate the version/update label safely if it becomes invalid.
- L9150 | `change` | files: - | Added guarded safeSetText() retry path for versionInfoText.
- L9151 | `change` | files: - | Added scene-liveness checks before/after async update checks.
- L9155 | `change` | files: - | Local build:
- L9159 | `change` | files: - | Please launch this build and try reproducing.
- L9163 | `change` | files: - | Remove credits completely, replace it with " Extra's" which contains unlockable concept art, achievements skins and such. Have each concept have their own categorty
- L9173 | `change` | files: - | I’ve added the new ExtrasScene; next I’m wiring it into booted scene registration so clicking EXTRA'S opens it cleanly.
- L9175 | `change` | files: - | I finished the code wiring and bundle update. I’m building the local EXE now so you can test immediately from your current launcher flow.
- L9177 | `change` | files: - | Done. Credits is fully removed and replaced with Extra's.
- L9199 | `change` | files: main.js | Added ExtrasScene to bundler order and scene registration in main.js.
- L9200 | `change` | files: - | Files updated
- L9208 | `change` | files: build-info.js | build-info.js
- L9209 | `change` | files: - | Local build
- L9215 | `change` | files: - | Also introduce jetpack with animations. So remove double jumping and make space bar activate it. Also include fuel meter for the jetpack
- L9219 | `change` | files: - | I identified the jump logic and HUD hooks. Next I’m patching GameScene to remove double-jump and add a SPACE jetpack with fuel drain/regeneration + flame animation, then updating UIScene to show a fuel meter.
- L9221 | `change` | files: - | I’m applying the gameplay refactor now: slower run speed, no midair second jump, SPACE jetpack thrust with fuel, jetpack flame animation, and HUD fuel bar. After patching, I’ll rebuild your EXE locally.
- L9225 | `change` | files: - | Implemented and rebuilt locally.
- L9231 | `change` | files: - | Removed double jump behavior:
- L9232 | `change` | files: - | Air-jump branch removed from gameplay update loop.
- L9234 | `change` | files: - | Added jetpack on SPACE:
- L9237 | `change` | files: - | Jetpack flame animation added (jetpack-flame-1/2) and follows player.
- L9238 | `change` | files: - | Added jetpack fuel HUD:
- L9241 | `change` | files: - | Added resize-safe HUD relayout hooks in UIScene.
- L9242 | `change` | files: - | Files updated
- L9247 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt bundle:
- L9250 | `change` | files: - | Build metadata regenerated:
- L9251 | `change` | files: build-info.js | build-info.js
- L9252 | `change` | files: - | Local build
- L9268 | `change` | files: - | Updated and rebuilt.
- L9286 | `change` | files: - | Tuned movement to remove the ice-skate feel and rebuilt.
- L9296 | `change` | files: - | Added hard stop behavior when no input on ground:
- L9300 | `change` | files: - | Files updated:
- L9304 | `change` | files: - | Local build:
- L9319 | `change` | files: - | Fixed and rebuilt.
- L9327 | `change` | files: - | Added a short guaranteed jetpack burst on activation (~180ms) so a quick second tap still triggers reliably.
- L9329 | `change` | files: - | Build:
- L9341 | `change` | files: - | I fixed both:
- L9344 | `change` | files: - | Added pause-menu diagnostics in debug logs:
- L9362 | `change` | files: - | Resolution presets are implemented in Options and native window mode now accepts target width/height. I’m running a full local EXE build now.
- L9364 | `change` | files: - | Added standard resolution selection in Options, low to high up to 4K, and wired it into native window resizing.
- L9366 | `change` | files: - | Added
- L9386 | `change` | files: - | added video.resolutionPreset
- L9389 | `change` | files: - | added resolution presets UI
- L9393 | `change` | files: - | added resolution sanitization/clamping
- L9394 | `change` | files: - | updated API set_window_mode(mode, width, height)
- L9395 | `change` | files: - | Local build
- L9401 | `intent` | files: - | Understood. I’ll hard-lock jetpack so it can only start from a true second-press (double-jump trigger), and never from just holding keys in air. I’m patching GameScene now and rebuilding.
- L9424 | `change` | files: - | Fixed.
- L9434 | `change` | files: - | Build:
- L9443 | `change` | files: - | Applied a stronger fix and rebuilt.
- L9450 | `change` | files: - | Added explicit opposingInput / neutralInput handling so conflict input is deterministic.
- L9452 | `change` | files: - | Build:
- L9472 | `change` | files: - | Build:
- L9479 | `change` | files: - | Got it. I’ll make jetpack activation require a deliberate airborne hold-and-release on SPACE or W/UP (double-jump stage), with a minimum hold time and a minimum active runtime once triggered. Then I’ll rebuild locally.
- L9481 | `change` | files: - | Jetpack hold-release activation and minimum active period are patched in. I’m rebuilding the EXE now.
- L9487 | `root-cause` | files: - | I found the root cause: movement still used acceleration/drag and then reapplied drag every frame, which reintroduced glide. I’m replacing horizontal movement with direct per-frame velocity (digital input) so there is zero slide.
- L9491 | `change` | files: - | Done. I removed horizontal sliding completely and made movement fully digital/snappy.
- L9494 | `change` | files: game-scene.js | Updated game-scene.js movement logic:
- L9500 | `change` | files: - | Build status
- L9501 | `change` | files: app.bundle.js, app.bundle.js.map | Rebuilt bundle: app.bundle.js and app.bundle.js.map
- L9502 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Rebuilt EXE locally: AnimePlatformer.exe (root updated)
- L9503 | `change` | files: - | Build version now: 2026.02.15.2346
- L9513 | `root-cause` | files: - | I found the likely root cause: activation currently waits for !jumpHeld (all jump keys up), so if one jump key is still held, jetpack never fires. I’m switching to explicit release detection (JustUp) and adding a small activation impulse boost + stronger diagnostics.
- L9515 | `root-cause` | files: - | Root cause found and fixed: jetpack activation depended on !jumpHeld (all jump keys released), so if one key stayed down for a frame, activation silently failed. That made it feel random.
- L9518 | `change` | files: game-scene.js | Updated game-scene.js:
- L9519 | `change` | files: - | Switched activation trigger from !jumpHeld to explicit key release detection via JustUp(...).
- L9520 | `change` | files: - | Kept hold-then-release behavior, but made it more reliable.
- L9522 | `change` | files: - | Added stale pending timeout reset (prevents “stuck pending” state).
- L9525 | `change` | files: - | Added additional debug warnings for blocked jetpack cases (fuel empty / dash blocking).
- L9526 | `change` | files: - | Build
- L9527 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt bundle + EXE locally.
- L9528 | `change` | files: - | New local build version: 2026.02.15.2350
- L9529 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | EXE updated at: AnimePlatformer.exe (project root)
- L9533 | `change` | files: - | Remove current jetpack system and start from ground up, do the following:
- L9580 | `change` | files: - | - Integrate into player update loop:
- L9591 | `change` | files: - | - Modified/added files with clean code and comments explaining key constants.
- L9598 | `change` | files: - | - Do not remove existing features; only extend them.
- L9600 | `change` | files: - | I’m starting by inspecting the current player update/input/grounded flow and existing jetpack code paths, then I’ll replace that with a dedicated Jetpack module and integrate it cleanly.
- L9602 | `change` | files: - | I’ve identified the current root issue area in GameScene.update. Next I’m extracting all jetpack logic into a dedicated module and wiring it through one integration point to avoid future regressions.
- L9606 | `change` | files: - | I’ve added the new module. I’m now replacing the old in-scene jetpack state machine with JetpackController integration points in GameScene (init/create/update/reset/HUD).
- L9608 | `change` | files: - | I’m replacing the old hold-release mini-state machine in update() with the new controller call so thrust, fuel, and guards all run in one place.
- L9610 | `change` | files: - | The refactor is in place. I’m rebuilding the bundle and EXE now and then I’ll report exactly what changed and where.
- L9612 | `change` | files: - | Implemented. I removed the old jetpack state machine from GameScene and rebuilt it as a dedicated module from scratch.
- L9616 | `change` | files: jetpack.js | Added jetpack.js
- L9621 | `change` | files: - | “not on same press as jump takeoff” rule (must release once after takeoff before thrust can start)
- L9628 | `change` | files: constants.js | Updated constants.js
- L9629 | `change` | files: - | Added Platformer.Config.JETPACK:
- L9637 | `change` | files: - | Added jetpack tuning notes comment block.
- L9638 | `change` | files: - | Added dev flag:
- L9641 | `change` | files: game-scene.js | Updated game-scene.js:
- L9642 | `change` | files: - | removed old scattered jetpack internals (pending/hold timers/burst state/etc.)
- L9644 | `change` | files: - | integrated one update call in update():
- L9652 | `change` | files: build_js_bundle.py | Updated build_js_bundle.py to include:
- L9657 | `change` | files: - | Physics: thrust uses acceleration, upward speed clamped, normal gravity resumes on release.
- L9661 | `change` | files: - | Build done
- L9662 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt bundle and EXE locally.
- L9663 | `change` | files: - | New local build version: 2026.02.16.0029
- L9664 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Updated executable: AnimePlatformer.exe in project root.
- L9699 | `change` | files: - | - Keep maxUpSpeed low to enforce “slow push up” (e.g., 20–40% of jump initial velocity).
- L9724 | `change` | files: - | - Update debug overlay/logging to show:
- L9728 | `change` | files: - | - Release mid-ascent: character transitions back to falling naturally (no snap).
- L9737 | `change` | files: - | I’ve confirmed the module currently still does a startup velocity kick, which causes the rocket-like snap. I’m replacing that with a pure acceleration-based anti-gravity ramp (with brake/lift phases and smooth release) and updating the jetpack tuning config keys accordingly.
- L9743 | `change` | files: - | Implemented. Jetpack now behaves like a gravity counter-force with smooth brake-then-lift instead of rocket snap.
- L9751 | `change` | files: - | Removed instant upward velocity kick behavior.
- L9752 | `change` | files: - | Added anti-gravity acceleration model with:
- L9755 | `change` | files: - | Added 2 phases:
- L9758 | `change` | files: - | Added clamping:
- L9763 | `change` | files: - | Added richer debug output fields:
- L9765 | `change` | files: constants.js | Updated jetpack tuning config in constants.js:
- L9767 | `change` | files: - | Added requested knobs:
- L9779 | `change` | files: - | Added “How to tune gravity-like jetpack” comment block.
- L9780 | `change` | files: - | Build
- L9781 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt bundle and EXE locally.
- L9782 | `change` | files: - | New local build version: 2026.02.16.0854
- L9783 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | EXE updated at: AnimePlatformer.exe (root)
- L9789 | `change` | files: - | Feels too light, jetpack needs to push me up a bit when jumping, needs to have a gravity and thrust working together
- L9791 | `intent` | files: - | Understood. I’ll keep the gravity-counter behavior but add a controlled upward thrust component (gravity + thrust together) plus a small non-snappy lift kick when thrust starts, then rebuild locally.
- L9795 | `change` | files: - | I’ve added blended thrust on top of anti-gravity and tuned it heavier. I’m rebuilding bundle + EXE now so you can feel this version immediately.
- L9806 | `change` | files: - | Added currentThrustAccel alongside currentAccel.
- L9809 | `change` | files: - | player.setAccelerationY(-currentThrustAccel) (actual upward push).
- L9816 | `change` | files: - | Tuned to less “feather float”, more controlled push:
- L9821 | `change` | files: - | Added tuning notes for these new knobs.
- L9822 | `change` | files: - | Build
- L9823 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt bundle + EXE locally.
- L9824 | `change` | files: - | New build version: 2026.02.16.0858
- L9825 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Root executable updated: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L9826 | `change` | files: - | If you want the push stronger on jump specifically, next fastest tweak is:
- L9832 | `change` | files: - | The only thing missing right now is when the player has vertical velocity and activating the jetpack, it should boost them higher, not slowly go down and let the jetpack push m further.
- L9836 | `root-cause` | files: - | I found the root cause: we were clamping upward speed to a low fixed cap, which can kill existing jump momentum on jetpack start. I’m adding a momentum-preserving dynamic cap (+small activation kick) so mid-air activation boosts higher instead of flattening first.
- L9842 | `change` | files: - | Good catch. I fixed momentum handling.
- L9845 | `change` | files: - | The jetpack had a fixed low upward cap, so activating during upward motion could flatten vertical momentum.
- L9850 | `change` | files: - | Added dynamic upward cap per activation:
- L9851 | `change` | files: - | on jetpack start, if player is already moving up, cap becomes based on current upward velocity instead of fixed low cap.
- L9852 | `change` | files: - | Added a small activation kick when activating while moving upward.
- L9856 | `change` | files: - | Added tuning knobs:
- L9860 | `change` | files: - | Build
- L9861 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt local bundle + EXE.
- L9862 | `change` | files: - | New build version: 2026.02.16.0902
- L9863 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | AnimePlatformer.exe in root is updated.
- L9872 | `change` | files: - | I’m tightening activation to strict hold behavior (no post-release thrust time), and increasing jetpack thrust with a stronger hard upward-speed cap so it feels stronger but never over-climbs.
- L9874 | `change` | files: - | I located it: jetpack was reading multiple keys (W, jump key, arrow-up), which explains unexpected activation windows. I’m restricting thrust input to SPACE only and removing release linger from the controller.
- L9876 | `change` | files: - | I’ve enforced strict “hold SPACE = thrust active, release = off instantly” and increased thrust while preserving a hard upward speed cap. Rebuilding now.
- L9884 | `change` | files: - | Removed W/up/jump-key from thrust activation path.
- L9887 | `change` | files: - | Removed post-release linger:
- L9888 | `change` | files: - | On release, jetpack acceleration and gravity override are set to 0 immediately.
- L9900 | `change` | files: - | Build
- L9901 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt locally.
- L9902 | `change` | files: - | New build version: 2026.02.16.0906
- L9903 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Root EXE updated: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L9915 | `change` | files: - | Jetpack is now strictly active only while SPACE is held (release = immediate off, no linger).
- L9916 | `change` | files: - | Updated tuning
- L9928 | `change` | files: - | Removed ramp-down linger on release; thrust/gravity override now drops instantly when released.
- L9929 | `change` | files: - | Build
- L9930 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt locally.
- L9932 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | AnimePlatformer.exe in root updated.
- L9938 | `change` | files: - | Fixed. That “upward reset” came from coyote jump being allowed to re-trigger in-air and forcing velocityY back to jump value.
- L9944 | `change` | files: - | Build
- L9945 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt locally.
- L9947 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Updated root EXE: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L9948 | `change` | files: - | This should remove the strange mid-air velocity reset while keeping current jetpack feel.
- L9969 | `change` | files: - | Build
- L9970 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt locally.
- L9972 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | AnimePlatformer.exe in root updated.
- L9976 | `change` | files: - | I’ll add a hard vertical speed clamp at the player level (up and down), wire it into the update loop, and rebuild so jetpack spikes can’t exceed safe limits.
- L9980 | `change` | files: - | Added a hard vertical velocity safety cap.
- L9985 | `change` | files: - | Added:
- L9990 | `change` | files: - | Updated arcade max-velocity setup to use PLAYER.maxFallSpeed.
- L9991 | `change` | files: - | Added per-frame vertical clamp in update():
- L9996 | `change` | files: - | Build
- L9997 | `change` | files: - | Rebuilt locally.
- L9999 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | Updated root EXE: AnimePlatformer.exe
- L10006 | `change` | files: - | Build maps in Tiled (.tmx / exported .json).
- L10024 | `change` | files: - | If you want, I can implement the full Tiled loader + schema next so you can build all future maps without touching code.
- L10049 | `change` | files: - | In-game editor if you want fastest “build/test/tweak” loop in your EXE.
- L10065 | `change` | files: test.ldtk | I added the converter. I’ll run it on test.ldtk now and generate a ready-to-use level JSON in assets/levels/.
- L10070 | `change` | files: convert_ldtk_to_level_json.py | Added converter script: convert_ldtk_to_level_json.py
- L10084 | `change` | files: - | If you want, next I can wire this into runtime as level-5 and add LDtk entity mapping (Spawn, Enemy, Coin, Checkpoint, Turret, Hazard) so you can build levels visually in LDtk end-to-end.
- L10106 | `change` | files: level-ldtk-test.json | Added preload: level-ldtk-test.json
- L10107 | `change` | files: - | Added 5 to the JSON cache load list.

- L12189 | `root-cause` | files: - | Perfect, this log gave the root cause: your player body is only 1.5x2.5, so collision is effectively broken and she sinks. I’m fixing body sizing to be world-size aware (independent of sprite scale) and rebuilding now.
- L12253 | `change` | files: - | I’ve switched tiny collision sizing to world-space and removed offset desync logic. Rebuilding now; this should stop the sink immediately if body scaling was the cause.

- L12261 | `root-cause` | files: - | Great, that log confirmed root cause: body was microscopic (bw=1.5 bh=2.5) due scale math.
- L12263 | `change` | files: - | I fixed it by setting player body size in world-space (converted by sprite scale) and rebuilt.
- L12274 | `change` | files: - | from the new build.
- L12276 | `change` | files: - | That INSIDE_TILE log confirms the previous build had a micro body (1.5x2.5) from scale math. I’ve now fixed sizing in world-space, and I’m applying one more strict fix: body offset will also be scale-correct (world->raw conversion), so feet alignment can’t drift into the ground. Then I’ll rebuild.

- L12397 | `change` | files: - | Run this build and if it still happens, send the new GameScene.collision lines. The next step would be to apply a small LDtk-solid top offset for level 5 only.
- L12408 | `change` | files: - | I’ll do two targeted fixes: lower the visual feet alignment by ~1px to remove the “floating” look, and remove the wall nudge that causes jitter/flicker when pressing into a wall. Then I’ll rebuild.

I’m switching hitbox persistence to the same durable game settings store used by your other options, then rebuilding.

- L15036 | `change` | files: - | Is actions needed for update version to work, why not just push it directly to git?>
- L15038 | `change` | files: - | For your current in-game updater: yes, Actions (or some release publisher) is needed.
- L15043 | `change` | files: - | A plain git push only updates source code.
- L15044 | `change` | files: AnimePlatformer.exe | The updater needs a new release tag + built AnimePlatformer.exe asset to download.

- L15047 | `change` | files: - | Push code (optional)
- L15048 | `change` | files: - | Create/push version tag (like 2026.02.16.1339)
- L15049 | `change` | files: - | Workflow builds EXE and uploads it to GitHub Release

- L15319 | `change` | files: - | I’ve replaced the wait logic with a deterministic batch loop. I’ll now build locally, push to main, and tag a new shadow release so you can retest updater behavior immediately.

- L15343 | `change` | files: - | Please retest update now.
- L15355 | `change` | files: - | Its say I'm update to, does it check latest version number, if current build version = lower get build from git, whats the logic?
- L15362 | `change` | files: - | Calls GitHub Releases API for zyynx-hub/Platformer (stable/latest release tag).
- L15364 | `change` | files: - | If remote > local: hasUpdate = true and stores release EXE download URL.
- L15368 | `change` | files: - | The latest published release tag is not higher than your local build.
- L15369 | `change` | files: - | The release exists but Actions hasn’t finished publishing assets yet.
- L15371 | `change` | files: - | If you want, I can quickly verify your exact local version + current remote release tag right now and tell you why it says up to date.
- L15374 | `change` | files: - | So you pushed v 1430 to git and build 1433 locally on my pc, with that logic it doesnt work, right?
- L15376 | `change` | files: - | Correct. With those numbers, updater should not offer update.
- L15378 | `change` | files: - | Remote release tag: 2026.02.16.1430
- L15379 | `change` | files: - | Your local build: 2026.02.16.1433
- L15385 | `change` | files: - | So push a  higher number
- L15387 | `change` | files: - | I’ll push a higher shadow release tag now (2026.02.16.1434) so your local 1433 detects it as an update.

- L15399 | `change` | files: - | Done. I pushed higher tag:
- L15402 | `change` | files: - | Since your local is 2026.02.16.1433, updater should now detect a newer version after the release workflow publishes assets.

- L15485 | `change` | files: - | Done. Pushed higher tag:
- L15488 | `change` | files: - | This is above local 2026.02.16.1441, so updater should detect it once release assets are published.
- L15492 | `change` | files: - | Done. Pushed higher tag:
- L15495 | `change` | files: - | This is higher than your local 2026.02.16.1441, so updater should detect it once the release finishes publishing.
- L15502 | `change` | files: - | That log is useful: the helper is likely killing its own process tree at that step (taskkill ... /T). I’m patching it to kill only the game PID (no /T), then rebuilding and pushing a higher shadow tag for retest.

- L16242 | `change` | files: - | I’ll debug why the bottom-left status stays on “Checking for updates…”, fix it in the update flow, and build locally only (no git push). I’m starting by tracing MenuScene ↔ UpdateManager ↔ updater result mapping.

- L18333 | `root-cause` | files: - | Root cause fixed: GameScene saw no player-idle-sheet when IFFY_IDLE load path failed, and there was no guaranteed sheet creation fallback in Boot.
- L18335 | `change` | files: - | I changed this locally (no Git push):
- L18338 | `change` | files: - | Added setupFallbackPlayerIdleSheet() that always builds player-idle-sheet from generated fallback idle textures.
- L18341 | `change` | files: IFFY_IDLE.png | Promoted IFFY_IDLE.png to required so bad builds fail early instead of silently degrading.

- L18421 | `change` | files: - | ## Build and Run
- L18422 | `change` | files: - | - Local build command:
- L18426 | `change` | files: build\portable_out\AnimePlatformer.exe | - Also in: `build\portable_out\AnimePlatformer.exe`
- L18430 | `change` | files: - | ## Update System (Important)
- L18431 | `change` | files: - | - In-game update checks GitHub Releases (repo configured in build info).
- L18432 | `change` | files: - | - Update replace flow is helper-script based (download temp EXE -> backup -> replace -> relaunch).
- L18437 | `change` | files: js/core/build-info.js, scripts/write_build_info.py | - `js/core/build-info.js` generated by `scripts/write_build_info.py`.
- L18450 | `change` | files: - | - Build locally by default unless explicitly asked to publish.
- L18452 | `change` | files: - | - If update anomalies happen, inspect `updater.log` first, then in-game debug logs.
- L18456 | `change` | files: build_portable_exe.bat | 2. Build once: `cmd /c build_portable_exe.bat`.
- L18462 | `change` | files: - | 4. Confirm update status line transitions from checking to final state.
- L18463 | `change` | files: - | Created file
- L18477 | `change` | files: js/core/build-info.js | - `js/core/build-info.js` (generated)

- L18507 | `change` | files: - | ## Build/Release Knowledge
- L18510 | `change` | files: scripts/write_build_info.py | - Build metadata: `scripts/write_build_info.py`
- L18512 | `change` | files: build_portable_exe.bat | - Full build: `build_portable_exe.bat`
- L18521 | `change` | files: - | ## Update Logic Summary
- L18523 | `change` | files: - | - Manual check via Update button.
- L18524 | `change` | files: - | - Version compare uses generated build version string.
- L18525 | `change` | files: - | - If remote release newer:
- L18548 | `change` | files: - | - Update stuck in “checking”:
- L18550 | `change` | files: - | - Mitigation: force terminal status update in menu update manager.
- L18555 | `change` | files: - | - Keep version monotonic for release-based updates.
- L18556 | `change` | files: - | Created file
- L18565 | `change` | files: - | 2. Check `updater.log` in repo root for update helper flow.
- L18573 | `change` | files: - | ## Update Issues
- L18576 | `change` | files: - | Update says available, helper starts, but app does not relaunch.
- L18587 | `change` | files: - | - Re-run update from menu once after verifying old process is closed.
- L18596 | `change` | files: - | - Treat as release-blocking. This is a content integrity failure.
- L18611 | `root-cause` | files: - | ### Root cause candidates
- L18616 | `change` | files: - | - `BootScene` now builds `player-idle-sheet` from generated fallback idle textures when source path fails.
- L18643 | `scm-command` | files: - | Ran git status --short
- L18647 | `change` | files: - | Created and added a hand-off + knowledge pack you can reuse in future sessions:
- L18657 | `change` | files: - | Critical paths (build, runtime, update)
- L18664 | `change` | files: - | Build/release pipeline references
- L18669 | `change` | files: - | Update failures playbook
- L18676 | `change` | files: - | I only added docs; I did not commit or push.
- L18677 | `change` | files: app.bundle.js, app.bundle.js.map, boot-scene.js, build-info.js, validate_assets.py | Your workspace still has pre-existing modified files (app.bundle.js, app.bundle.js.map, build-info.js, boot-scene.js, validate_assets.py) plus updater.log untracked.

## 2026-02-16 Strict Cleanup Pass
- Local code hardening: updater now blocks unverified update packages that lack checksum (`desktop_launcher.py`).
- Stable/latest GitHub release lookup changed to web-first strategy with API fallback to reduce rate-limit churn (`desktop_launcher.py`).
- Verified issue docs updated and mirrored:
  - `docs/history/OPEN_ISSUES_VERIFIED_WITH_NOISE.md`
  - `docs/history/OPEN_ISSUES_VERIFIED.md`
- Unresolved tracker synchronized with strict-pass status and superseding references.
