# Chat History Knowledge Pack

Canonical source: `CHAT_HISTORY_RAW.md`

This folder splits the long transcript into maintainable reference docs:

- `docs/history/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`: current project scope/state and stable conventions.
- `docs/history/ARCHITECTURE_AND_DECISIONS.md`: key architecture changes and why they were made.
- `docs/history/INCIDENTS_AND_ROOT_CAUSES.md`: recurring failures, root causes, and fixes.
- `docs/history/OPERATIONS_AND_RELEASES.md`: build/update/release operating model.

Use this pack for future sessions before touching gameplay, updater, or release pipeline code.
