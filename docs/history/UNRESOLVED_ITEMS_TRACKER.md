# Unresolved Items Tracking (Line-Referenced)

Source: `CHAT_HISTORY_RAW.md`

## Strict Pass Update (2026-02-16)
- This tracker is superseded for active triage by:
  - `docs/history/OPEN_ISSUES_VERIFIED_WITH_NOISE.md`
  - `docs/history/OPEN_ISSUES_VERIFIED.md`
- Current verified real-open issue count after strict cleanup pass: `0`.

Method:
- Collect issue/problem/failure/crash/still-not-working statements from non-code lines.
- Attempt closure linking to later fixed/resolved/root-cause lines via keyword overlap.
- Keep uncertain items as open to avoid missing anything.

Issue candidates with inferred closure: 436
Issue candidates still open/uncertain: 262

## Open Or Uncertain Items (Needs Verification)
- L824 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L1982 (low confidence score=1) | Variable jump height still applies to both jumps.
- L935 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L1424 (low confidence score=1) | So even if the GIF fails or stalls, the game still boots and is playable.
- L973 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L2052 (low confidence score=1) | Still this, is gif possible in current code stack/
- L986 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L1496 (low confidence score=1) | Why this fixes your issue:

- L2330 | Status: `Needs verification` | No closure found | Still happens
- L2334 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L6798 (low confidence score=1) | Applied a hard fix so this cluster case is blocked by rules, not just by hand-placed coordinates.
- L2351 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L6321 (low confidence score=1) | Turrets still spawn in location where shooting doesnt matter
- L2375 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L5028 (low confidence score=1) | Please hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) and re-test. If you still see one bad turret, send the level number and approximate x-position and I’ll pin that exact lane manually.
- L2379 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L2596 (low confidence score=1) | Now the enmies are stuck in the cracks, if they're stuck they should jump
- L2385 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L2420 (low confidence score=1) | Implemented. Enemies now try to escape when stuck in cracks.
- L2390 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L2777 (low confidence score=1) | if grounded, barely moving, and stuck for ~320ms, enemy:

- L2697 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L6562 (low confidence score=1) | That removes the CORS/WebGL issue completely.
- L2714 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L6679 (low confidence score=1) | If the idle still looks off visually, next step is just tuning:
- L3037 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L14065 (low confidence score=1) | Doesn't do anything
- L3108 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L3155 (low confidence score=1) | Added fatal launcher crash logging with traceback.

- L3175 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L3474 (low confidence score=1) | You’re missing game feel + progression cohesion. Right now it has features, but not a strong core loop.
- L3276 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L6679 (low confidence score=1) | If it still feels weak, next tweak is easy: increase dashSpeed in constants.js (e.g. 520-560) or extend dashDurationMs slightly.
- L3394 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L7706 (low confidence score=1) | If replacement fails:
- L3444 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L3557 (low confidence score=1) | Error, see image
- L3577 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8831 (low confidence score=1) | Still seems to have the weird fullscreen bug, why is this happening.

- L4196 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L4253 (low confidence score=1) | Token cannot access repo API: GET /repos/zyynx-hub/Platformer -> 404
- L4198 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L4253 (low confidence score=1) | So this is a permissions/scope issue for that token on that repo, not a code issue.
- L4409 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L7744 (low confidence score=1) | Publish error: 401 Bad credentials
- L4515 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L5028 (low confidence score=1) | Applied a fix for your error path and rebuilt.

- L6661 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L7201 (low confidence score=1) | 20. Update Dialog Doesn't Re-Check After Network Restored
- L6911 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L7181 (low confidence score=1) | Why you may still see reset
- L6921 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L7706 (low confidence score=1) | If it still resets, send:
- L7150 | Status: `Needs verification` | No closure found | Still happens when resizing
- L7214 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L7216 (low confidence score=1) | Still cant scroll
- L7366 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L7447 (low confidence score=1) | - Collisions: player cannot walk through walls/water/blocked regions (simple bounding boxes OK)

- L7649 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L10101 (low confidence score=1) | Resizing doesn't work in level selection

- L7900 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8338 (low confidence score=1) | - [ ] Old debug map still available via flag
- L7980 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8532 (low confidence score=1) | Top-down avatar movement, blocked-region collision, facing flip.
- L8194 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8281 (low confidence score=1) | If it still looks old, send the bottom-left version text screenshot so I can confirm you’re on 1734 before Sprint 3.
- L8313 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9842 (low confidence score=1) | Lines to nodes aren't showing, I was expecting to see this as an error, remember to always try and catch code to see if something is working or not, implement this always with everything so I can send logging why something isn't working
- L8322 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8338 (low confidence score=1) | Added defensive error logging (try/catch) around world-map render stages.
- L8349 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8494 (low confidence score=1) | Kept hard error logging/diagnostics in place for all render stages.
- L8350 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8992 (low confidence score=1) | Path rendering still uses explicit Line objects with strong visibility.
- L8439 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8992 (low confidence score=1) | Old debug map path should still be available.
- L8498 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L12406 (low confidence score=1) | What I changed for your issue:
- L8508 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8992 (low confidence score=1) | Phaser play success/failure
- L8509 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8992 (low confidence score=1) | HTML fallback play success/failure
- L8514 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L17763 (low confidence score=1) | logs when audio instance creation fails
- L8524 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8551 (low confidence score=1) | If still silent, copy those log lines; they now explicitly tell why (volume 0, blocked playback, load error, suspended context, etc.).
- L8525 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L12113 (low confidence score=1) | If you want, next I can force an on-screen red warning banner whenever music fails (not just debug log).
- L8570 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L14875 (low confidence score=1) | WorldMap.unlock: Blocked move from <node>...
- L8687 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9036 (low confidence score=1) | Resize window and confirm map + background still lay out correctly.
- L8745 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9146 (low confidence score=1) | Crash/log checklist with reproducible test matrix
- L8774 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9105 (low confidence score=1) | If this is still not the look you want, next sprint I can do one of these directions exactly:
- L8780 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8992 (low confidence score=1) | Changing settings doesn't do anything anymore
- L8850 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9073 (low confidence score=1) | Fullscreen off works, fullscreen on doesn't, also make a bordeles option
- L8892 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8994 (low confidence score=1) | If OptionsScene fails to launch, menu UI is restored automatically.
- L8893 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8992 (low confidence score=1) | Error is logged to debug as MenuScene.options.
- L8895 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9146 (low confidence score=1) | Any init crash logs to debug as OptionsScene.create.
- L8908 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L8994 (low confidence score=1) | When clicking first time in option, doesn't display, debug menu also not showing.
- L8924 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9036 (low confidence score=1) | options-failed with message on any startup error
- L8958 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L12113 (low confidence score=1) | If still blank, copy the new debug lines around:
- L8986 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L15413 (low confidence score=1) | If still not visible, copy the new lines containing:
- L9009 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9038 (low confidence score=1) | If this still fails, send one screenshot plus the latest OptionsScene.create debug lines and I’ll pin exact CSS coordinates next.
- L9012 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9399 (low confidence score=1) | Before doing anything, when click "ESC" it displays, before doesn't
- L9031 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9105 (low confidence score=1) | If it still fails, send the OptionsScene.dom line from debug, and I’ll pin exact dimensions/position for your display profile.
- L9034 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9073 (low confidence score=1) | Still doesn't do anything, only when click ESC debug displays
- L9052 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9073 (low confidence score=1) | Still only displays when clicking esc
- L9066 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9487 (low confidence score=1) | If this still requires ESC, I’ll switch the Options panel to a pure Phaser UI (no DOM at all), which will eliminate this class of WebView DOM timing issues completely.
- L9098 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9105 (low confidence score=1) | If it still happens, I’ll do the final hard switch: replace Options with pure Phaser UI (no HTML DOM) so ESC/fullscreen can’t affect its rendering path at all.
- L9125 | Status: `Needs verification` | No closure found | Cannot read properties of null (reading 'drawImage')
- L9146 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9319 (low confidence score=1) | What I fixed for this crash:
- L9160 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L10939 (low confidence score=1) | If it still happens, send the new === COPY_THIS_TO_ASSISTANT === block and I’ll patch it immediately.
- L9351 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L12113 (low confidence score=1) | If it still overlaps, send the new debug lines for:
- L9439 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9491 (low confidence score=1) | Sliding still happens
- L9504 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9515 (low confidence score=1) | If you still feel any “slide,” send a short clip and I’ll tighten it further (including in-air horizontal response).
- L9507 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9513 (low confidence score=1) | jetpack is completely broken, sometimes works, sometimes doesn't, but mostly doesn't, find route cuase
- L9521 | Status: `Needs verification` | No closure found | Reduced minimum hold threshold from 130ms to 85ms (still intentional hold, less missed activations).
- L9522 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L9938 (low confidence score=1) | Added stale pending timeout reset (prevents “stuck pending” state).
- L9801 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L17788 (low confidence score=1) | So it feels heavier but still gives a real lift when engaged.
- L9870 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L16786 (low confidence score=1) | And still feels a bit too weak, increase the thrust of the jetpack but make a cap on how fast it can go in height
- L10452 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L10643 (low confidence score=1) | Layer grid (__gridSize): 8 (this is the problem)
- L10515 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L10643 (low confidence score=1) | If you want, I can add a strict startup check now that logs an error and blocks loading when LDtk grid is not 32, so this is obvious immediately.
- L10527 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L16253 (low confidence score=1) | Apply camera zoom (x4) so it still looks readable.
- L10951 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L12276 (low confidence score=1) | but placeholder # ground sprites were still rendered on top,
- L10952 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L11571 (low confidence score=1) | so it looked like “missing tiles.”
- L11696 | Status: `Needs verification` | No closure found | Wall-hug stuck fix
- L11698 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L11922 (low confidence score=1) | In tiny mode, if pressing into a blocked wall:
- L11796 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L12189 (low confidence score=1) | If this still sinks visually on your LDtk map, next step is making spawn use “stand-on-ground probe” (scan upward from spawn until no overlap) which will fully decouple it from tile art thickness.
- L11805 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L12406 (low confidence score=1) | Still not good
- L11844 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L12029 (low confidence score=1) | This removes the “centered collider causes sink” issue.
- L11884 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L12113 (low confidence score=1) | If this still looks wrong on your side, the next fix is not player-side anymore: we need to shift LDtk solid collision rows up by 1 tile/pixel offset for this tileset’s visual top line. That will fully align all entities to the grass line consistently.
- L12086 | Status: `Needs verification` | Possible related closure at L12276 (low confidence score=1) | Make an error log if it detecs it's inside a tile, it's still inside the ground

## Items With Inferred Closure (Verify Once)
- L908 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1861 (score=6) | Issue: You’re seeing Phaser’s missing-texture placeholder, which means the GIF key didn’t load at runtime. I’ll switch loading to a direct Image() path (works better when opening index.html directly) and add a fallback if the file still can’t be read. | Closure text: I found the likely cause: on Play, startGameplayMusicNow() only tried immediate Phaser sound.add/play and returned on failure, so it could miss the first click window. I’m making it robust with lazy load + input retry + HTML fallback directly in that path.
- L910 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1424 (score=2) | Issue: That screenshot is the Phaser missing-texture pattern. I fixed it in main.js by changing how the GIF is loaded: | Closure text: Fixed. R on game over now restarts the level directly instead of returning to main menu.
- L915 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2169 (score=2) | Issue: Added a safe fallback in UIScene.buildVictoryCharacter() if the GIF still fails. | Closure text: Perfect trace. Root cause is clear: UIScene.updateHud() is still being triggered during scene teardown, and setText() runs on a text object whose underlying canvas has already been disposed. I’m adding a defensive HUD-update guard + safe listener lifecycle to prevent this crash path.
- L918 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2635 (score=3) | Issue: this.load.image() can fail in some file:// runs (no local server), while direct Image() loading is more reliable for local open. | Closure text: Great, this confirms the root cause: Phaser fails to load the file itself, so animation never gets created. I’ll add a robust loader (multiple filename fallbacks + load-error logging) and validate the image file signature.
- L919 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17013 (score=2) | Issue: If it still shows fallback on your browser, run with a tiny local server: | Closure text: I confirmed the root cause and validated the fallback path in code. I’m now rebuilding your local EXE so this fix is live in the desktop app immediately.
- L927 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L929 (score=4) | Issue: I can reproduce the likely failure mode: startup is gated on an async image callback, so if the browser never fires it, the game never leaves Boot scene. I’m removing that gate so menu always starts immediately, with the victory image loading opportunistically in background. | Closure text: Fixed. The freeze was caused by Boot scene waiting on the GIF load callback before starting the game.
- L943 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L3557 (score=2) | Issue: If it still shows a blank blue screen after this, I’ll add a tiny on-screen boot debug text + error trap to pinpoint the exact failing line in your browser. | Closure text: Fixed the boot error.
- L949 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6815 (score=2) | Issue: I see the problem: the victory panel is created before the GIF texture is ready, so it stays on the text fallback. I’m changing it to build/rebuild the character panel at the moment victory starts, so it uses the actual kawaii-anime-girl.gif if available. | Closure text: I found likely root cause for settings reset: EXE runs from a changing temp extraction path, so browser localStorage origin can change between boots. I’m adding persistent host-side settings storage in the Python launcher and wiring JS to read/write it, and I’ll re-enable debug panel for desktop builds.
- L955 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1424 (score=2) | Issue: Updated main.js so the actual kawaii-anime-girl.gif is used at victory time instead of getting stuck on the fallback. | Closure text: Fixed. R on game over now restarts the level directly instead of returning to main menu.
- L968 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17013 (score=2) | Issue: If it still shows fallback, run from a local server (not file://): | Closure text: I confirmed the root cause and validated the fallback path in code. I’m now rebuilding your local EXE so this fix is live in the desktop app immediately.
- L975 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8992 (score=3) | Issue: GIFs are possible here, but not as reliable animated Phaser textures. I’m switching the victory girl to a DOM <img> overlay inside Phaser UI, which will display/animate the GIF natively and avoid the texture-loading fallback issue. | Closure text: I see it clearly: Options scene is active (title/back render), but the HTML options panel isn’t being painted. I’m removing the fragile overlay DOM path: Options will open as its own scene and mount the settings panel directly to document.body (fixed overlay), which avoids this Phaser DOM layering bug entirely. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L1010 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9399 (score=2) | Issue: Kept all movement physics intact (coyote/buffer/double jump still work). | Closure text: When you're done doing this, make sure the jetpack only activates with a (simular to) double jumping, so at the double jump, activate the jetpack
- L1269 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8994 (score=4) | Issue: You’re right; the pause-menu part wasn’t applied yet. I’m verifying the current scene code and patching the missing ESC pause panel (Resume, Options, Return to Menu) now. | Closure text: I replaced the Options overlay DOM path with a fixed body-mounted panel and switched menu -> options to dedicated scene mode. Rebuilding now.
- L1271 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7128 (score=3) | Issue: I’ve applied the missing pause-menu logic now. I’m doing a quick scan for wiring issues (pause key guard, options return-to-pause event, and menu button visibility) before confirming. | Closure text: I’ve patched the resize/layout path and menu-overlay visibility. I’m rebuilding now; this should keep Options centered and prevent the menu buttons from showing through.
- L1297 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1338 (score=5) | Issue: I see the issue pattern: enemies are reaching a left edge but can get stuck “indecisive” instead of committing to the turn. I’m tightening patrol logic with a short turn cooldown + nudge-back after edge detection so they reliably return. | Closure text: Left enemy stuck: fixed by falling back to dynamic edge sensing when computed patrol span is too short.
- L1310 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7706 (score=2) | Issue: If you still see one specific tile where they hesitate, send that screenshot and I’ll tune the probe distance for that geometry. | Closure text: If it still fails, send one screenshot from 1646 and I’ll lock this by disabling world-map scaling entirely and using fixed map pixels + letterbox (guaranteed stable).
- L1313 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1317 (score=2) | Issue: Still left-edge stall | Closure text: Patched with a stronger fix for left-edge stall.
- L1334 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1338 (score=2) | Issue: Thanks, this points to patrol-range logic overconstraining specific spawn points. I’m switching enemies to a hybrid patrol mode: bounded when valid range exists, otherwise dynamic edge-sensing with clean turn rules. That should fix both the stuck-left and jitter-right cases. | Closure text: Left enemy stuck: fixed by falling back to dynamic edge sensing when computed patrol span is too short.
- L1338 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1339 (score=2) | Issue: Left enemy stuck: fixed by falling back to dynamic edge sensing when computed patrol span is too short. | Closure text: Right enemy jitter/bug: fixed by cleaner boundary checks (else if), no hard clamp lock, and guarded turn cooldown.
- L1358 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14875 (score=2) | Issue: blocked.left/right | Closure text: Build is done locally (2026.02.16.1338), but GitHub publish from this machine is blocked right now because no GH_TOKEN is set. I’m now preparing a minimal commit (just updater-log path change) and pushing to trigger your GitHub Actions “shadow update” flow instead.
- L1364 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17240 (score=2) | Issue: If one specific enemy still freezes, send that exact position and I’ll add per-enemy debug text to inspect its live dir/velocity/blocked/touching state. | Closure text: I’m going straight at this specific LDtk fallback issue, trace the exact loader path in GameScene, patch only that root cause, then build and push a new release so testers can verify. I’ll keep every other system untouched.
- L1496 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L3431 (score=3) | Issue: Fixed layout spacing issue on fullscreen. | Closure text: Fixed menu layout on resize/fullscreen
- L1546 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L12406 (score=3) | Issue: Good catch. The issue is level data: several spike tiles were placed over pit coordinates, so they appear floating/misaligned. I’m moving hazard positions to guaranteed supported tiles so spikes always sit properly on ground. | Closure text: As you can see, the character kinda floats above the ground now, the fasing into the ground issue has been resolved so good job on that. Also when you walk against a wall, it start flickering and jittering, fix this
- L1586 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14065 (score=2) | Issue: game doesn't boot, screen looks like this | Closure text: This confirms root cause: updater handoff starts, but the game process doesn’t fully terminate, so helper never completes.
- L1588 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1640 (score=3) | Issue: This usually means a scene script error is stopping right after Boot. I’m checking the latest menu/music changes for a syntax/runtime issue and patching immediately. | Closure text: Fixed the overlapping menu music issue.
- L1590 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1861 (score=4) | Issue: I found the likely culprit: menu music loading/play can fail in some browser contexts and stop menu creation. I’m making music loading non-blocking and failure-safe so the game always boots, even if audio fails. | Closure text: I found the likely cause: on Play, startGameplayMusicNow() only tried immediate Phaser sound.add/play and returned on failure, so it could miss the first click window. I’m making it robust with lazy load + input retry + HTML fallback directly in that path.
- L1596 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1861 (score=3) | Issue: Menu music load/play path could fail and break scene startup in some environments (especially local file:// + autoplay restrictions). | Closure text: I found the likely cause: on Play, startGameplayMusicNow() only tried immediate Phaser sound.add/play and returned on failure, so it could miss the first click window. I’m making it robust with lazy load + input retry + HTML fallback directly in that path.
- L1606 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1861 (score=2) | Issue: no hard failure if load fails | Closure text: I found the likely cause: on Play, startGameplayMusicNow() only tried immediate Phaser sound.add/play and returned on failure, so it could miss the first click window. I’m making it robust with lazy load + input retry + HTML fallback directly in that path.
- L1609 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2635 (score=2) | Issue: If you want, I can also add a tiny “Music unavailable (file://)” notice when audio loading fails. | Closure text: Great, this confirms the root cause: Phaser fails to load the file itself, so animation never gets created. I’ll add a robust loader (multiple filename fallbacks + load-error logging) and validate the image file signature.
- L1614 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2635 (score=4) | Issue: I’ll add a browser-native audio fallback for menu music (new Audio(...)) when Phaser loader fails, so it works better in local file mode too. I’ll patch MenuScene now. | Closure text: Great, this confirms the root cause: Phaser fails to load the file itself, so animation never gets created. I’ll add a robust loader (multiple filename fallbacks + load-error logging) and validate the image file signature.
- L1616 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1861 (score=3) | Issue: Added a fallback so menu music can still play if Phaser audio loading fails. | Closure text: I found the likely cause: on Play, startGameplayMusicNow() only tried immediate Phaser sound.add/play and returned on failure, so it could miss the first click window. I’m making it robust with lazy load + input retry + HTML fallback directly in that path.
- L1625 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1857 (score=2) | Issue: If music still doesn’t play, it’s likely browser file:// restrictions. | Closure text: Still doesn't play when user clicks "play" from start menu, only start playing after playing is done reading the turtorial
- L1640 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1812 (score=3) | Issue: Fixed the overlapping menu music issue. | Closure text: Fixed. Pause music now stops when returning to main menu and won’t overlap the menu track.
- L1673 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1812 (score=3) | Issue: Play still stops menu music before game starts. | Closure text: Fixed. Pause music now stops when returning to main menu and won’t overlap the menu track.
- L1693 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1857 (score=3) | Issue: Music doesn't start playing | Closure text: Still doesn't play when user clicks "play" from start menu, only start playing after playing is done reading the turtorial
- L1695 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1861 (score=6) | Issue: Got it. I’m making gameplay music playback robust like the menu: lazy-load if needed, retry on user input (autoplay-safe), and HTML-audio fallback if Phaser audio fails. I’ll patch GameScene plus menu cleanup for game-audio fallback. | Closure text: I found the likely cause: on Play, startGameplayMusicNow() only tried immediate Phaser sound.add/play and returned on failure, so it could miss the first click window. I’m making it robust with lazy load + input retry + HTML fallback directly in that path.

I’m making it robust with lazy load + input retry + HTML fallback directly in that path.
- L1711 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1857 (score=2) | Issue: If it still doesn’t play, run via local server (python -m http.server 8000) since file:// can block media more aggressively. | Closure text: Still doesn't play when user clicks "play" from start menu, only start playing after playing is done reading the turtorial
- L1766 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1812 (score=3) | Issue: I spotted one edge case: opening Options from pause could clear the “resume game music” state. I’m applying a quick fix so game music still resumes correctly after returning from Options. | Closure text: Fixed. Pause music now stops when returning to main menu and won’t overlap the menu track.

I’m making it robust with lazy load + input retry + HTML fallback directly in that path.
- L1859 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L1861 (score=4) | Issue: Thanks, that means the Play click is still not being used as the actual audio-unlock moment for game-bgm. I’m going to move “start game music” directly into the Play button handler path and remove any conflicting stop/restart calls that can cancel it during scene transition. | Closure text: I found the likely cause: on Play, startGameplayMusicNow() only tried immediate Phaser sound.add/play and returned on failure, so it could miss the first click window. I’m making it robust with lazy load + input retry + HTML fallback directly in that path.
- L1861 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15413 (score=6) | Issue: I found the likely cause: on Play, startGameplayMusicNow() only tried immediate Phaser sound.add/play and returned on failure, so it could miss the first click window. I’m making it robust with lazy load + input retry + HTML fallback directly in that path. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: the helper is hanging in the tasklist | find check, and your visible CMD window suggests fallback launch path is being used. I’m removing that fragile PID-check loop and switching to a direct forced-kill handoff, plus tightening helper launch flags to avoid the visible console.
- L1870 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8992 (score=3) | Issue: falls back to HTML audio if Phaser audio fails | Closure text: I see it clearly: Options scene is active (title/back render), but the HTML options panel isn’t being painted. I’m removing the fragile overlay DOM path: Options will open as its own scene and mount the settings panel directly to document.body (fixed overlay), which avoids this Phaser DOM layering bug entirely. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L1876 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14065 (score=2) | Issue: The game doesn't feel challenging at all, just a boring jumping game | Closure text: This confirms root cause: updater handoff starts, but the game process doesn’t fully terminate, so helper never completes.
- L1978 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9399 (score=2) | Issue: The projectiles still break blocks, and make sure all the turrents can shoot, the turret at the beginning isn't shooting | Closure text: When you're done doing this, make sure the jetpack only activates with a (simular to) double jumping, so at the double jump, activate the jetpack
- L2004 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2010 (score=3) | Issue: When first load of the game, music doesn't start playing when "play", only when going ingame, returning back to menu from pause menu and clicking "play", again the music starts playing. Remove the feature that plays in the level guide section of the game, just let the music play only in the main game | Closure text: Done. I removed the “play during level guide/preview” behavior.
- L2029 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2052 (score=5) | Issue: I’ll harden scene transitions for replay: before starting a new run from menu, I’ll explicitly reset UIScene/GameScene state so Play can’t crash from lingering active scenes. I’m patching MenuScene and IntroScene start flow now. | Closure text: I found a likely root cause: UIScene re-registers keyboard/game-event listeners every run and never removes them, so after returning to menu and replaying, handlers stack and can crash the game flow. I’m patching proper listener cleanup now.
- L2031 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2052 (score=3) | Issue: Patched likely crash cause: stale active scenes when starting a new run. | Closure text: I found a likely root cause: UIScene re-registers keyboard/game-event listeners every run and never removes them, so after returning to menu and replaying, handlers stack and can crash the game flow. I’m patching proper listener cleanup now.
- L2047 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8338 (score=2) | Issue: If it still crashes, I’ll add a one-frame transition guard and scene-state debug print to isolate the remaining edge case quickly. | Closure text: Perfect debug capture. Root cause found: drawPaths() was running before node index initialization, so every edge lookup returned null. I’m fixing the render order/indexing now and rebuilding the EXE.
- L2052 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2169 (score=5) | Issue: I found a likely root cause: UIScene re-registers keyboard/game-event listeners every run and never removes them, so after returning to menu and replaying, handlers stack and can crash the game flow. I’m patching proper listener cleanup now. | Closure text: Perfect trace. Root cause is clear: UIScene.updateHud() is still being triggered during scene teardown, and setText() runs on a text object whose underlying canvas has already been disposed. I’m adding a defensive HUD-update guard + safe listener lifecycle to prevent this crash path.
- L2054 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2169 (score=3) | Issue: Fixed likely crash root cause. | Closure text: Perfect trace. Root cause is clear: UIScene.updateHud() is still being triggered during scene teardown, and setText() runs on a text object whose underlying canvas has already been disposed. I’m adding a defensive HUD-update guard + safe listener lifecycle to prevent this crash path.
- L2060 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2169 (score=2) | Issue: After returning to menu and replaying, handlers stacked and could crash/break scene flow. | Closure text: Perfect trace. Root cause is clear: UIScene.updateHud() is still being triggered during scene teardown, and setText() runs on a text object whose underlying canvas has already been disposed. I’m adding a defensive HUD-update guard + safe listener lifecycle to prevent this crash path.
- L2073 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7767 (score=4) | Issue: Please retest that exact loop again. If it still crashes, I’ll add a one-line on-screen error tracer to capture the exact failing callback path. | Closure text: I’ve patched the crash path. I’ll rebuild/install locally now so you can retest the exact failing sequence immediately.
- L2076 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17788 (score=3) | Issue: Game still craches, lets try this a different way, I need to be able to get a debugging screen, so somewhere on the screen that opens a terminal console that shows me what is happening in real time and displays clear error messages where something went wrong, so change everything with try & catch so everything it loaded properly and display this in the console also. With that, if there is an error message, give a clear copy + paste section so I can give clear instruction on what is going wrong, make it in your own language I dont care, needs to be clear for you | Closure text: I also noticed one warning was only a diagnostic (Resolved embedded player (spawn)) caused by fallback map geometry. I’m changing that spawn-specific message to INFO so only real collision failures stay as warnings.
- L2078 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2084 (score=4) | Issue: Makes sense. I’ll add an in-game debug console overlay with real-time logs/errors, global error capture (onerror + unhandled promises), and safe scene wrappers so exceptions are caught and shown instead of silently crashing. I’ll also include a one-click “copy latest error” block for you to paste back. | Closure text: Done. I added a real in-game debug console so you can capture exactly what breaks.
- L2097 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7744 (score=2) | Issue: Copy-ready error block | Closure text: If level-selection still misbehaves, send one screenshot + one new error block (if any), and I’ll do the final lock (fixed map viewport + letterbox only in WorldMap scene).
- L2116 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7767 (score=4) | Issue: This will give me precise crash source/stack and I can patch the exact failing path fast. | Closure text: I’ve patched the crash path. I’ll rebuild/install locally now so you can retest the exact failing sequence immediately.
- L2127 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2635 (score=5) | Issue: Great, that confirms we’re hitting the classic masked browser error (Script error.) with no stack. I’ll unmask it by enabling cross-origin stack capture for Phaser CDN and improve the debug handler to log filename/line/column/script-tag load failures. Then you can send a useful trace. | Closure text: Great, this confirms the root cause: Phaser fails to load the file itself, so animation never gets created. I’ll add a robust loader (multiple filename fallbacks + load-error logging) and validate the image file signature.
- L2147 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7767 (score=3) | Issue: The next block should include file/line so I can patch the exact crash immediately. | Closure text: I’ve patched the crash path. I’ll rebuild/install locally now so you can retest the exact failing sequence immediately.
- L2169 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6815 (score=5) | Issue: Perfect trace. Root cause is clear: UIScene.updateHud() is still being triggered during scene teardown, and setText() runs on a text object whose underlying canvas has already been disposed. I’m adding a defensive HUD-update guard + safe listener lifecycle to prevent this crash path. | Closure text: I found likely root cause for settings reset: EXE runs from a changing temp extraction path, so browser localStorage origin can change between boots. I’m adding persistent host-side settings storage in the Python launcher and wiring JS to read/write it, and I’ll re-enable debug panel for desktop builds.
- L2173 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7729 (score=3) | Issue: Great report. I fixed the exact crash source from your trace. | Closure text: Good catch. I fixed the crash path from your stack trace and installed a new local build.

I’m removing that fragile PID-check loop and switching to a direct forced-kill handoff, plus tightening helper launch flags to avoid the visible console.
- L2191 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L5028 (score=3) | Issue: Please test the same crash flow again. If anything still breaks, send the next copied error block and I’ll patch immediately. | Closure text: I patched the exact crash path. I’ll rebuild and push this fix, then trigger another release tag so your in-game updater can test the corrected apply flow.
- L2232 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17331 (score=2) | Issue: Implementing this now by validating the 4-level enemy setup end-to-end in the codebase, then I’ll patch any missing pieces so each level has a distinct enemy archetype and progression works cleanly. | Closure text: I’ve confirmed the root cause path: when ldtk-test is missing in cache, level 5 can silently fall all the way back to the old builder map. I’m now adding a dedicated level-5 built-in fallback and a targeted preload guard so testers always get level 5 data instead of classic fallback, then I’ll build and release.
- L2234 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2420 (score=2) | Issue: I found the project files; next I’m checking level-data, game-scene, and boot-scene to confirm all 4 levels and unique enemy behaviors are wired without missing references. | Closure text: Done. I refactored levels into separate files and replaced the layouts with wider, cleaner geometry to avoid crack-stuck enemies.
- L2236 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L5229 (score=3) | Issue: I found the root issue: GameScene was still building the map with createLevelData() without passing this.currentLevel, so level-specific layouts weren’t actually loading. I’m patching that now. | Closure text: I found the root cause in MenuScene: it still has auto-update logic and a permissive notes formatter. I’m patching those now so updates are only manual and the changelog panel is clean/fits correctly.
- L2332 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2777 (score=2) | Issue: I’ll harden placement rules instead of just tuning coordinates: enforce minimum distance from spawn and between turrets/enemies during normalization, so these bad clusters cannot happen even if a level marker is off. | Closure text: Done. I replaced the enemy texture generator so enemies now use a creature-style sprite matching your reference vibe (round blue hood, white face, big eyes, little legs) instead of block monsters.
- L2347 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17240 (score=3) | Issue: Do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) and check again. If one specific level still has a bad pocket, I’ll pin exact per-level safe spawn lanes (no normalization fallback there). | Closure text: I’m going straight at this specific LDtk fallback issue, trace the exact loader path in GameScene, patch only that root cause, then build and push a new release so testers can verify. I’ll keep every other system untouched.
- L2359 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L3474 (score=2) | Issue: Fixed. The turret system was still over-correcting into bad positions. | Closure text: You’re right. The menu is now filling correctly, but the layout is scaling with full window size, which shifts perceived button positions. I’m locking the menu composition to a fixed design frame (centered) so fullscreen won’t “zoom” the UI layout anymore.
- L2381 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L3416 (score=3) | Issue: I’ll add stuck recovery to enemy AI: when an enemy is grounded and not making horizontal progress for a short window, it will force a hop and reverse direction to escape cracks. | Closure text: I found the root cause: resize is oscillating between window size and pywebview outer-window size, which floods logs and leaves menu layout stuck at old dimensions. I’m fixing this by using a single resize authority and making the main menu relayout dynamically on every resize.
- L2383 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6321 (score=2) | Issue: I found a quick bug in that patch (now was undefined in create); I’m correcting it immediately so the game won’t error. | Closure text: I found your logs, but they’re being written to temp extraction folders (_MEI...) and %TEMP%, which explains why you couldn’t find them at the new path. I’m checking the latest entries now, then I’ll patch logging to one fixed location permanently.
- L2402 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6206 (score=2) | Issue: Stuck-recovery logic inside patrol update: game-scene.js (line 813) | Closure text: I’ve identified a likely root cause: the helper relaunch is too “single-shot.” I’m adding retry-based relaunch logic in the updater script plus Windows job breakaway flags when spawning the helper, then pushing a new tag for immediate update testing.
- L2405 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2449 (score=2) | Issue: Still happens, fix this with a different method, completely change the lay-out | Closure text: Fixed with a different method.
- L2420 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2777 (score=2) | Issue: Done. I refactored levels into separate files and replaced the layouts with wider, cleaner geometry to avoid crack-stuck enemies. | Closure text: Done. I replaced the enemy texture generator so enemies now use a creature-style sprite matching your reference vibe (round blue hood, white face, big eyes, little legs) instead of block monsters.
- L2443 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17788 (score=2) | Issue: Moving enemies still have nowhere to go, its like they can only spawn on x height, check this | Closure text: I also noticed one warning was only a diagnostic (Resolved embedded player (spawn)) caused by fallback map geometry. I’m changing that spawn-specific message to INFO so only real collision failures stay as warnings.
- L2462 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2635 (score=2) | Issue: If one still gets stuck, send the level number and I’ll pin that enemy lane directly in that level file (level-X.js) instead of relying on normalization for that slot. | Closure text: Great, this confirms the root cause: Phaser fails to load the file itself, so animation never gets created. I’ll add a robust loader (multiple filename fallbacks + load-error logging) and validate the image file signature.
- L2511 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17782 (score=3) | Issue: I’m wiring it now as requested: auto-load IFFY_IDLE.png, split into 4 frames, create spikeAnim at 12 FPS loop, and apply it to all turret hazards in-game with fallback if the file is missing. | Closure text: Ran rg -n "menu-bgm loaderror|Failed to create menu-bgm sound instance|Missing cached ldtk-test JSON; using Level 5 fallback data \(JSON/built-in\)|Resolved embedded player \(spawn\)|menu-bgm not found in cache" js/scenes/*.js
- L2533 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2635 (score=3) | Issue: Keeps fallback to old static hazard texture if file fails to load | Closure text: Great, this confirms the root cause: Phaser fails to load the file itself, so animation never gets created. I’ll add a robust loader (multiple filename fallbacks + load-error logging) and validate the image file signature.
- L2562 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L2596 (score=4) | Issue: player uses playerIdleAnim while idle (run/jump still use existing textures) | Closure text: Root cause: idle animation only played when the player texture was already player-idle-sheet. After first jump/fall state, it switched to legacy textures and never came back.
- L2577 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17810 (score=4) | Issue: So the game is still using fallback idle sprites, because the actual PNG image file is missing. | Closure text: Ran rg -n "menu-bgm loaderror|menu-bgm add failed|menu-bgm not found in cache|Resolved embedded player \(spawn\)|player-idle-sheet missing, using fallback idle textures" js/scenes
- L2611 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16786 (score=2) | Issue: I’ll quickly check how your debug overlay is wired, then I’ll explain exactly why this kind of issue can fail silently without errors. | Closure text: Root cause found: the debug log area uses a fixed height: calc(100% - 58px) even though extra rows were added above it, so the log overflows under the panel border. I’m switching the panel to a flex column layout so the log area always fits exactly.
- L2613 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17810 (score=4) | Issue: You’re not seeing errors because this is mostly a logic/fallback path, not a thrown exception. I’ll add explicit debug warnings so missing/unused player idle animation shows up in your debug console immediately. | Closure text: Ran rg -n "menu-bgm loaderror|menu-bgm add failed|menu-bgm not found in cache|Resolved embedded player \(spawn\)|player-idle-sheet missing, using fallback idle textures" js/scenes
- L2617 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15413 (score=4) | Issue: Your debug panel logs window.onerror / rejected promises. This issue was a fallback logic path (valid code path), so it silently used default idle textures instead of crashing. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: the helper is hanging in the tasklist | find check, and your visible CMD window suggests fallback launch path is being used. I’m removing that fragile PID-check loop and switching to a direct forced-kill handoff, plus tightening helper launch flags to avoid the visible console.
- L2632 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17810 (score=6) | Issue: [23:11:19] [WARN] GameScene.playerIdle: player-idle-sheet missing, using fallback idle textures. | Closure text: Ran rg -n "menu-bgm loaderror|menu-bgm add failed|menu-bgm not found in cache|Resolved embedded player \(spawn\)|player-idle-sheet missing, using fallback idle textures" js/scenes

- L2641 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15413 (score=3) | Issue: No error was shown because this was a non-crashing fallback path. The game kept running and used default idle textures. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: the helper is hanging in the tasklist | find check, and your visible CMD window suggests fallback launch path is being used. I’m removing that fragile PID-check loop and switching to a direct forced-kill handoff, plus tightening helper launch flags to avoid the visible console.
- L2653 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L18333 (score=3) | Issue: Now you should get a precise “which path failed” message if it still doesn’t load. | Closure text: Root cause fixed: GameScene saw no player-idle-sheet when IFFY_IDLE load path failed, and there was no guaranteed sheet creation fallback in Boot.

I’m patching the game config to use Canvas renderer by default (avoids this texture CORS path), and I’ll keep local-server as the recommended run mode. | Closure text: I’m going straight at this specific LDtk fallback issue, trace the exact loader path in GameScene, patch only that root cause, then build and push a new release so testers can verify. I’ll keep every other system untouched.

I’ll switch to a no-Node packaging path (Python WebView + PyInstaller) so you still get a sendable .exe. | Closure text: Build is done locally (2026.02.16.1338), but GitHub publish from this machine is blocked right now because no GH_TOKEN is set. I’m now preparing a minimal commit (just updater-log path change) and pushing to trigger your GitHub Actions “shadow update” flow instead.
- L2945 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9073 (score=5) | Issue: I found a critical state issue: your source files (index.html, js/, assets/) are no longer in the workspace root, only build artifacts remain. I need to locate/restore the source tree first before I can add the update button safely. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: desktop build is forcing fullscreen twice (native wrapper + browser fullscreen API). That can leave DOM/UI in a bad pre-resize state until ESC. I’m disabling browser fullscreen for desktop host and letting native mode be the only fullscreen authority.
- L3015 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L3047 (score=2) | Issue: When changing window to fullscreen, it doesn't automatically adjust | Closure text: Root cause: fullscreen in your desktop app must be controlled by pywebview window API, not browser fullscreen API.
- L3034 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L3047 (score=2) | Issue: If it still misses one transition on your machine, I can make the poll interval tighter (e.g. 150ms) or only when window is focused/fullscreen. | Closure text: Root cause: fullscreen in your desktop app must be controlled by pywebview window API, not browser fullscreen API.
- L3064 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14065 (score=2) | Issue: This is how it looks and doesn't display in console, refactor the entire game so everything is prompted into the console, every possible warning, every possible not wanted outcome | Closure text: This confirms root cause: updater handoff starts, but the game process doesn’t fully terminate, so helper never completes.
- L3066 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6321 (score=3) | Issue: I’m going to implement a real diagnostics layer, not just error trapping: scene lifecycle logs, loader warnings, fullscreen/window-size mismatch warnings, and explicit pywebview API outcome logging. I’ll also patch fullscreen resizing via native window-size polling so the black-area case is detected and corrected. | Closure text: I found your logs, but they’re being written to temp extraction folders (_MEI...) and %TEMP%, which explains why you couldn’t find them at the new path. I’m checking the latest entries now, then I’ll patch logging to one fixed location permanently.
- L3070 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L3416 (score=4) | Issue: Telemetry hooks are added. Next I’m wiring them in main.js and replacing resize polling with pywebview native size checks so fullscreen size changes are captured even when JS events fail. | Closure text: I found the root cause: resize is oscillating between window size and pywebview outer-window size, which floods logs and leaves menu layout stuck at old dimensions. I’m fixing this by using a single resize authority and making the main menu relayout dynamically on every resize.
- L3072 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L3416 (score=4) | Issue: Main sync now logs and uses native window size. I’ll add explicit logs for fullscreen toggle success/failure in OptionsScene so you can see exact outcomes instead of silent catches. | Closure text: I found the root cause: resize is oscillating between window size and pywebview outer-window size, which floods logs and leaves menu layout stuck at old dimensions.

- L3080 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17331 (score=3) | Issue: I confirmed your debug framework is in place, but it still misses many gameplay-specific warnings. I’m now adding centralized runtime checks (entity placement, invalid physics states, missing assets/audio, scene transitions, and config anomalies) so unwanted outcomes are logged even when no exception is thrown. | Closure text: I’ve confirmed the root cause path: when ldtk-test is missing in cache, level 5 can silently fall all the way back to the old builder map. I’m now adding a dedicated level-5 built-in fallback and a targeted preload guard so testers always get level 5 data instead of classic fallback, then I’ll build and release.
- L3088 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9513 (score=2) | Issue: I’m now adding scene-level diagnostics for non-crash issues (stalls, invalid states, bad placements, out-of-bounds entities), so these appear as warnings even when gameplay keeps running. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: activation currently waits for !jumpHeld (all jump keys up), so if one jump key is still held, jetpack never fires. I’m switching to explicit release detection (JustUp) and adding a small activation impulse boost + stronger diagnostics.
- L3103 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15917 (score=2) | Issue: Existing error capture (window.onerror, unhandledrejection, resource load errors) remains. | Closure text: I’ve identified a likely root cause: PyInstaller restart can inherit stale _MEIPASS2/_PYI_* environment from the updater chain, which can trigger exactly this python313.dll load failure. I’m patching the helper to scrub those env vars before relaunch, and also silencing console echo so that black cmd window won’t appear.
- L3130 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7706 (score=2) | Issue: If you run it now, you should see live console output immediately. If something still fails silently, send me the newest runtime-debug.log tail and I’ll pinpoint the exact subsystem. | Closure text: If it still fails, send one screenshot from 1646 and I’ll lock this by disabling world-map scaling entirely and using fixed map pixels + letterbox (guaranteed stable).
- L3173 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14065 (score=2) | Issue: The game doesn't feel like its good enough, what am I missing | Closure text: This confirms root cause: updater handoff starts, but the game process doesn’t fully terminate, so helper never completes.
- L3259 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L3263 (score=3) | Issue: You’re right; I found the issue: dash speed was being hard-capped by setMaxVelocity to normal run speed. I’m fixing that cap and tightening dash impulse so it clearly outruns walking. | Closure text: Fixed. Dash was capped by normal max velocity, so it couldn’t exceed walk/run speed.
- L3329 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6679 (score=2) | Issue: Backup/rollback if replacement fails | Closure text: I’ve patched startup rollback activation. Next I’m adding build-time release note generation and asset/backup cleanup scripts, then wiring them into CI and local builds.
- L3330 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16869 (score=3) | Issue: Progress + clear success/failure status in your debug panel | Closure text: Debug panel log area used fixed height: calc(100% - 58px) while extra rows (status, hitbox info, hitbox controls) were added above it.
- L3338 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6206 (score=4) | Issue: Yes, correct: you need a hosted source for updates (GitHub Releases works well). I’ll still implement the full in-app Update + Restart flow now (download -> helper script swap -> relaunch, with rollback and progress logs), and then I’ll show exactly what you must host. | Closure text: I’ve identified a likely root cause: the helper relaunch is too “single-shot.” I’m adding retry-based relaunch logic in the updater script plus Windows job breakaway flags when spawning the helper, then pushing a new tag for immediate update testing.
- L3348 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6679 (score=2) | Issue: Backup/rollback: keeps AnimePlatformer.exe.bak; if replace fails, it restores backup and relaunches old EXE. | Closure text: I’ve patched startup rollback activation. Next I’m adding build-time release note generation and asset/backup cleanup scripts, then wiring them into CI and local builds.
- L3408 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L3618 (score=2) | Issue: And yes, you still need one hosted source once (e.g. GitHub Releases + manifest URL). After that, players won’t need to manually keep up to date. | Closure text: Players will never see “manifest URL,” and no manual setup will be required in the shipped game.
- L3416 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7591 (score=6) | Issue: I found the root cause: resize is oscillating between window size and pywebview outer-window size, which floods logs and leaves menu layout stuck at old dimensions. I’m fixing this by using a single resize authority and making the main menu relayout dynamically on every resize. | Closure text: I found the root cause: the world map is drawn in a large fixed world space, but resize can make the visible viewport crop/offset that space. I’m fixing it by fitting the map to the camera on every resize and pinning all map UI with scrollFactor(0) so it stays correctly anchored.
- L3420 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7544 (score=2) | Issue: The code fixes are done, but the rebuild failed because AnimePlatformer.exe is still running (file lock). I’m stopping the running process and rebuilding now. | Closure text: I’ve patched the runtime and launcher; next I’m rebuilding and replacing your local AnimePlatformer.exe so you can verify resize behavior immediately.
- L3441 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9105 (score=2) | Issue: One rebuild initially failed because the EXE was still running (WinError 5 file lock). I closed the running process and rebuilt successfully. | Closure text: I’ll lock the three display modes to fixed resolutions in the desktop wrapper exactly as you requested, then rebuild locally: fullscreen 1960x1080, border-mode 1960x1080 with window borders, windowed 1377x727.
- L3450 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7744 (score=3) | Issue: Good catch. That screenshot was a viewport mismatch, not a gameplay error. | Closure text: If level-selection still misbehaves, send one screenshot + one new error block (if any), and I’ll do the final lock (fixed map viewport + letterbox only in WorldMap scene).
- L3468 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7744 (score=4) | Issue: If you still see a right-side gap with this build, send one new screenshot + copied latest debug block, and I’ll lock it further at the pywebview host level (content-size sync from Python side). | Closure text: If level-selection still misbehaves, send one screenshot + one new error block (if any), and I’ll do the final lock (fixed map viewport + letterbox only in WorldMap scene).
- L3493 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8496 (score=2) | Issue: Build failed once because the EXE was still running/locked; I stopped it and rebuilt successfully. | Closure text: I fixed and rebuilt locally. New EXE is ready at AnimePlatformer.exe (build 2026.02.15.1810).
- L3495 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16510 (score=2) | Issue: Still same issue | Closure text: Still the same issue, find the root cause
- L3497 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9487 (score=3) | Issue: I found why it still feels zoomed: I anchored the menu to a 1366x768 design frame, which is larger than your original game composition. I’m switching it back to the original 960x540 reference so element positions match the old layout proportions. | Closure text: I found the root cause: movement still used acceleration/drag and then reapplied drag every frame, which reintroduced glide. I’m replacing horizontal movement with direct per-frame velocity (digital input) so there is zero slide.
- L3512 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9938 (score=2) | Issue: This should place buttons back to the expected composition. If it still looks off on your display scaling, next step is forcing app DPI awareness in desktop_launcher.py so Windows scaling can’t distort coordinate mapping. | Closure text: Fixed. That “upward reset” came from coyote jump being allowed to re-trigger in-air and forcing velocityY back to jump value.
- L3516 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L12406 (score=3) | Issue: Still same issue, also look how the resulution is feked, tekst is blurry, doesn't look good. | Closure text: As you can see, the character kinda floats above the ground now, the fasing into the ground issue has been resolved so good job on that. Also when you walk against a wall, it start flickering and jittering, fix this
- L3518 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7128 (score=3) | Issue: You’re right, this is now a DPI/rendering problem more than a plain layout problem. I’m applying two concrete fixes: make the EXE DPI-aware (to stop Windows blur scaling) and tighten Phaser render settings for sharper text/sprites, then I’ll re-anchor menu placement without the centered design-frame offset. | Closure text: I’ve patched the resize/layout path and menu-overlay visibility. I’m rebuilding now; this should keep Options centered and prevent the menu buttons from showing through.
- L3548 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16510 (score=2) | Issue: “same issue” button placement drift in fullscreen. | Closure text: Still the same issue, find the root cause
- L3553 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15413 (score=3) | Issue: Thanks, that boot error is on me. The ?desktop=1 query on the local file:///... URL can break in Edge WebView on some systems. I’m removing that URL hack and switching detection to a safe runtime check so boot works again. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: the helper is hanging in the tasklist | find check, and your visible CMD window suggests fallback launch path is being used. I’m removing that fragile PID-check loop and switching to a direct forced-kill handoff, plus tightening helper launch flags to avoid the visible console.
- L3557 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7744 (score=2) | Issue: Fixed the boot error. | Closure text: If level-selection still misbehaves, send one screenshot + one new error block (if any), and I’ll do the final lock (fixed map viewport + letterbox only in WorldMap scene).
- L3574 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7081 (score=2) | Issue: Please run this build. If blur/layout is still off after this, I’ll add one more hard fix: explicit device-pixel-ratio scaling lock + font-size normalization by DPR in the menu scene. | Closure text: Patched. I’m rebuilding now; after this, opening Options from main menu will keep the menu scene alive and animated underneath.
- L3594 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7128 (score=3) | Issue: If this still misaligns, next step is to bypass RESIZE mode entirely and use FIT + centered camera UI layer, which is the most stable path for pywebview fullscreen/input consistency. | Closure text: I’ve patched the resize/layout path and menu-overlay visibility. I’m rebuilding now; this should keep Options centered and prevent the menu buttons from showing through.
- L3736 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6968 (score=2) | Issue: verify basic file checks (size > minimum threshold), then apply; else fail safely | Closure text: I patched the intro-resize behavior to safely complete intro and re-layout immediately when window size changes. I’ll rebuild locally now.
- L3752 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L4419 (score=2) | Issue: Manual update button still works as fallback. | Closure text: Done, make new release to check if update works
- L3756 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15917 (score=2) | Issue: Debug console still captures updater lifecycle | Closure text: I’ve identified a likely root cause: PyInstaller restart can inherit stale _MEIPASS2/_PYI_* environment from the updater chain, which can trigger exactly this python313.dll load failure. I’m patching the helper to scrub those env vars before relaunch, and also silencing console echo so that black cmd window won’t appear.
- L3837 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6798 (score=2) | Issue: Legacy manifest/download values are now cleared on save/reset (still backward compatible internally). | Closure text: Found the root cause: settings save had a hard 1KB cap and silently replaced oversized settings with defaults, which resets audio/video values on reboot. I’m removing that cap and rebuilding locally.
- L3875 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16907 (score=4) | Issue: I’ll verify the GitHub release endpoint for zyynx-hub/Platformer and map the exact failure to a clearer in-game status so it says what’s wrong (for example: no release published yet vs network issue). | Closure text: I confirmed the root cause locally: unauthenticated GitHub API calls are hitting HTTP 403 rate limit exceeded. I’m patching the Python bridge to automatically fall back to the GitHub web release endpoint when API is rate-limited, plus better network fallback/logging.
- L3877 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L5292 (score=3) | Issue: The endpoint returns 404 Not Found, so the game cannot find a public “latest release” for that repo yet. I’ll make the in-game message explicit (No public release found yet) instead of generic network failure. | Closure text: Done. Latest public release was downloaded directly to:
- L3903 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14875 (score=3) | Issue: Implemented. Build/publish is no longer blocked by the running EXE. | Closure text: Build is done locally (2026.02.16.1338), but GitHub publish from this machine is blocked right now because no GH_TOKEN is set. I’m now preparing a minimal commit (just updater-log path change) and pushing to trigger your GitHub Actions “shadow update” flow instead.
- L3908 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6815 (score=2) | Issue: Builds to AnimePlatformer.exe (never blocked by locked root EXE). | Closure text: I found likely root cause for settings reset: EXE runs from a changing temp extraction path, so browser localStorage origin can change between boots. I’m adding persistent host-side settings storage in the Python launcher and wiring JS to read/write it, and I’ll re-enable debug panel for desktop builds.
- L3920 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14875 (score=3) | Issue: If root EXE is running/locked, build and GitHub publish can still proceed. | Closure text: Build is done locally (2026.02.16.1338), but GitHub publish from this machine is blocked right now because no GH_TOKEN is set. I’m now preparing a minimal commit (just updater-log path change) and pushing to trigger your GitHub Actions “shadow update” flow instead.
- L3938 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L18364 (score=3) | Issue: This folder is not a Git repository (.git missing), so I can’t push from here yet. I’ll quickly check parent folders for an existing repo location so we can push without re-setup if possible. | Closure text: I’ll create a concise hand-off package in the repo with a current-state summary, run/build/release procedures, known pitfalls, and a troubleshooting playbook based on everything we’ve done so far. I’m checking existing docs first so I place it in the right location.
- L3944 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14875 (score=3) | Issue: Commit was blocked by missing git identity. I’m setting repo-local identity (zyynx-hub + GitHub noreply) so push can proceed immediately. | Closure text: Build is done locally (2026.02.16.1338), but GitHub publish from this machine is blocked right now because no GH_TOKEN is set. I’m now preparing a minimal commit (just updater-log path change) and pushing to trigger your GitHub Actions “shadow update” flow instead.

- L3978 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7292 (score=2) | Issue: Still same message, client should force close, only push to github and get update status from there | Closure text: Done. Everything is pushed to GitHub and update flow remains wired.
- L3982 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15413 (score=6) | Issue: I found the exact cause: desktop_launcher.py still had one old fallback string in the GitHub path. I’m removing that, dropping manifest fallback entirely, and making the build script force-close the running client before replacing the root EXE. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: the helper is hanging in the tasklist | find check, and your visible CMD window suggests fallback launch path is being used. I’m removing that fragile PID-check loop and switching to a direct forced-kill handoff, plus tightening helper launch flags to avoid the visible console.
- L4011 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6815 (score=3) | Issue: If you still see the old text after launching the new EXE, send the debug panel copy block and I’ll trace the exact code path immediately. | Closure text: I found likely root cause for settings reset: EXE runs from a changing temp extraction path, so browser localStorage origin can change between boots. I’m adding persistent host-side settings storage in the Python launcher and wiring JS to read/write it, and I’ll re-enable debug panel for desktop builds.
- L4030 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15799 (score=4) | Issue: Backend test passed for both no-release and release repos. Next I’ll verify the runtime updater is now GitHub-only and no manifest fallback is still active. | Closure text: I’ve patched helper rollback logic and switched Actions to Python 3.13. Next I’m rebuilding locally, pushing main, and tagging a higher release for another updater test.
- L4071 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15799 (score=3) | Issue: So the updater logic is working, but there is still no published release asset and no auth token available in this environment to publish one automatically. | Closure text: I’ve patched helper rollback logic and switched Actions to Python 3.13. Next I’m rebuilding locally, pushing main, and tagging a higher release for another updater test.
- L4149 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17331 (score=2) | Issue: Classic token missing repo scope. | Closure text: I’ve confirmed the root cause path: when ldtk-test is missing in cache, level 5 can silently fall all the way back to the old builder map. I’m now adding a dedicated level-5 built-in fallback and a targeted preload guard so testers always get level 5 data instead of classic fallback, then I’ll build and release.
- L4173 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15917 (score=2) | Issue: If you paste the output of those two API checks, I’ll tell you exactly which permission is missing. | Closure text: I’ve identified a likely root cause: PyInstaller restart can inherit stale _MEIPASS2/_PYI_* environment from the updater chain, which can trigger exactly this python313.dll load failure. I’m patching the helper to scrub those env vars before relaunch, and also silencing console echo so that black cmd window won’t appear.
- L4197 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16907 (score=2) | Issue: Publish fails for same reason: release endpoint returns 404 | Closure text: I confirmed the root cause locally: unauthenticated GitHub API calls are hitting HTTP 403 rate limit exceeded. I’m patching the Python bridge to automatically fall back to the GitHub web release endpoint when API is rate-limited, plus better network fallback/logging.
- L4251 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16907 (score=3) | Issue: I’ll verify the public GitHub endpoint right now from outside auth. If it still returns 404, the repo/release isn’t publicly visible to players (most likely private repo), which explains this exact message. | Closure text: I confirmed the root cause locally: unauthenticated GitHub API calls are hitting HTTP 403 rate limit exceeded. I’m patching the Python bridge to automatically fall back to the GitHub web release endpoint when API is rate-limited, plus better network fallback/logging.
- L4298 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14065 (score=2) | Issue: If it still shows old text, fully close the game and relaunch the latest AnimePlatformer.exe (to ensure you’re not on an older running binary). | Closure text: This confirms root cause: updater handoff starts, but the game process doesn’t fully terminate, so helper never completes.
- L4378 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L4385 (score=3) | Issue: Publish succeeded, but GitHub releases/latest is still returning 1045. I’m checking the 1049 release metadata now (likely marked as prerelease/draft or missing published timestamp), then I’ll patch/fix it so latest points to 1049. | Closure text: Fixed GitHub “latest” pointer to that release (make_latest=true).
- L4401 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6206 (score=4) | Issue: I see it. That WinError 87 is coming from the desktop network call path, not from gameplay logic. I’m patching the launcher updater to use a safer direct HTTP opener (no broken system proxy dependency), plus clearer fallback handling for this exact Windows error. | Closure text: I’ve identified a likely root cause: the helper relaunch is too “single-shot.” I’m adding retry-based relaunch logic in the updater script plus Windows job breakaway flags when spawning the helper, then pushing a new tag for immediate update testing.
- L4403 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16253 (score=2) | Issue: I’m also hardening the UI-side mapping so if this Windows-specific network error ever bubbles up again, players get a clean actionable status instead of raw [WinError 87]. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: transient auto-check retries can loop indefinitely and keep overwriting status with “Checking for updates…”. I’m patching UpdateManager to cap retries and surface a final readable status instead of looping forever.
- L4509 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L4613 (score=2) | Issue: and send me the status of the latest Build and Release EXE run (success/fail). | Closure text: Installing build dependencies: finished with status 'done'
- L4511 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17240 (score=4) | Issue: I’m going to harden update checks so they don’t depend solely on GitHub’s API (which can fail/rate-limit). I’ll add a fallback that reads the latest release tag from github.com/.../releases/latest redirect, then rebuild and push. | Closure text: I’m going straight at this specific LDtk fallback issue, trace the exact loader path in GameScene, patch only that root cause, then build and push a new release so testers can verify. I’ll keep every other system untouched.
- L4530 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16786 (score=3) | Issue: If it still errors, copy the latest debug line from panel (now includes backend exception type), and I’ll patch exactly that codepath. | Closure text: Root cause found: the debug log area uses a fixed height: calc(100% - 58px) even though extra rows were added above it, so the log overflows under the panel border. I’m switching the panel to a flex column layout so the log area always fits exactly.
- L4534 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L13681 (score=2) | Issue: I’ll run a focused verification of the new updater fallback behavior: normal GitHub check, forced API-failure fallback, and version comparison output. Then I’ll report pass/fail clearly. | Closure text: Done. I used GitHub Actions flow and triggered a new release build for updater testing.

The release workflow is failing because CI is using Python 3.14 and pywebview 6.1 pulls pythonnet, which fails to build there. I’m patching CI to use a stable Python + pinned pywebview that doesn’t hit that build path, then I’ll push and retrigger release. | Closure text: previous pythonnet failure root cause is addressed (python interpreter path now used in workflow).
- L4788 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L4790 (score=3) | Issue: I’ll push this workflow fix and trigger a new tag so GitHub Actions builds/releases cleanly without the pythonnet failure. | Closure text: Fixed. Your Actions failure was caused by pythonnet build on Python 3.14.

I’m patching the workflow to use python everywhere so it uses the configured 3.11 interpreter. | Closure text: previous pythonnet failure root cause is addressed (python interpreter path now used in workflow).

Root cause is confirmed: | Closure text: I’ve identified a likely root cause: PyInstaller restart can inherit stale _MEIPASS2/_PYI_* environment from the updater chain, which can trigger exactly this python313.dll load failure. I’m patching the helper to scrub those env vars before relaunch, and also silencing console echo so that black cmd window won’t appear.
- L5028 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7767 (score=5) | Issue: I patched the exact crash path. I’ll rebuild and push this fix, then trigger another release tag so your in-game updater can test the corrected apply flow. | Closure text: I’ve patched the crash path. I’ll rebuild/install locally now so you can retest the exact failing sequence immediately.
- L5037 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6815 (score=4) | Issue: previous pythonnet failure root cause is addressed (python interpreter path now used in workflow). | Closure text: I found likely root cause for settings reset: EXE runs from a changing temp extraction path, so browser localStorage origin can change between boots.

- L5081 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L11571 (score=2) | Issue: Confirmed, that overlap is still too tight. I’m widening the vertical spacing in the top-right UI cluster so update status sits cleanly below Update and above What’s Changed with no collision. | Closure text: I found the likely cause: tiny-grid body sizing/offset and spawn overlap weren’t strict enough for 8px collision tiles. I’m adding a proper tiny collision box + anti-embed resolver (spawn/respawn/runtime) and rebuilding.
- L5107 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15552 (score=2) | Issue: PowerShell separator issue again; running push and tag in separate commands now. | Closure text: Clear root cause now: killing the old PID is terminating the helper before it can continue. I’m removing PID-kill/wait from the helper entirely and relying on copy-retry lock release (which is safer and already implemented). Then I’ll build, push, and tag a higher version again.
- L5194 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6434 (score=2) | Issue: If restart still fails, send the contents of anime_platformer_updater.log and I’ll fix that exact step. | Closure text: I shipped another restart fix focused on your exact failure mode.

I’m patching those now so updates are only manual and the changelog panel is clean/fits correctly. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: transient auto-check retries can loop indefinitely and keep overwriting status with “Checking for updates…”. I’m patching UpdateManager to cap retries and surface a final readable status instead of looping forever.
- L5231 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L13681 (score=3) | Issue: I’m also checking the desktop updater bridge (desktop_launcher.py) to ensure restart is actually triggered after apply, since that part is independent of the menu UI and can still fail even with correct JS flow. | Closure text: Done.

- L6172 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6206 (score=4) | Issue: Good catch. That message is from the helper script cleanup step, not the update copy itself. I’ll patch the updater to clean up silently (no “batch file cannot be found”), then push/tag so you can update immediately. | Closure text: I’ve identified a likely root cause: the helper relaunch is too “single-shot.” I’m adding retry-based relaunch logic in the updater script plus Windows job breakaway flags when spawning the helper, then pushing a new tag for immediate update testing.

- L6247 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6396 (score=2) | Issue: If it fails on your machine, it’s an environment/permissions/AV lock issue, not a missing restart path in code. | Closure text: Fixed and pushed a restart path rewrite.
- L6271 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6394 (score=3) | Issue: I added persistent updater logging under updater.log with fallback creation. I’m committing and tagging this now so you can update and immediately get logs even if restart fails. | Closure text: Patched and validated.

I’m now preparing a minimal commit (just updater-log path change) and pushing to trigger your GitHub Actions “shadow update” flow instead.
- L6390 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15917 (score=6) | Issue: I’m going to remove the fragile restart loop that can hang the helper window, replace it with a simpler guaranteed relaunch sequence, and hide the helper console so you don’t get stuck on that black screen.

I’m patching the helper to scrub those env vars before relaunch, and also silencing console echo so that black cmd window won’t appear.

I’m patching the helper to scrub those env vars before relaunch, and also silencing console echo so that black cmd window won’t appear.
- L6411 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17240 (score=4) | Issue: I’ll fix this warning spam at the source: clean up the player-idle loader so it does one clear check, no repeated fallback URL attempts, and only logs once when IFFY_IDLE.png is missing. Then I’ll push/tag so you can update. | Closure text: I’m going straight at this specific LDtk fallback issue, trace the exact loader path in GameScene, patch only that root cause, then build and push a new release so testers can verify. I’ll keep every other system untouched.
- L6424 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17833 (score=2) | Issue: Replaced with one clean warning if missing: | Closure text: Root cause: missing player-idle-sheet logged as warning every run path.
- L6425 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15413 (score=2) | Issue: optional asset missing -> fallback character used. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: the helper is hanging in the tasklist | find check, and your visible CMD window suggests fallback launch path is being used. I’m removing that fragile PID-check loop and switching to a direct forced-kill handoff, plus tightening helper launch flags to avoid the visible console.
- L6430 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17240 (score=4) | Issue: I’m implementing a stronger relaunch strategy now: the helper will use a PowerShell retry loop that confirms the new process actually stays alive, then fallback to start/explorer only if that fails. After patch I’ll push/tag immediately. | Closure text: I’m going straight at this specific LDtk fallback issue, trace the exact loader path in GameScene, patch only that root cause, then build and push a new release so testers can verify.

- L6541 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14065 (score=4) | Issue: This log shows the real issue: many helper runs start, but most never reach replace ok, so they’re getting stuck before file replacement (likely waiting on/competing with a still-running process). I’m fixing the updater to wait on the exact current PID, force-kill if needed, and log every failure reason, then I’ll push/tag. | Closure text: This confirms root cause: updater handoff starts, but the game process doesn’t fully terminate, so helper never completes.
- L6559 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7706 (score=2) | Issue: If it still fails, send the newest updater.log and I’ll pin it down from the new retry lines. | Closure text: If it still fails, send one screenshot from 1646 and I’ll lock this by disabling world-map scaling entirely and using fixed map pixels + letterbox (guaranteed stable).

I’ll build the newest EXE locally from current code (4e50243) and place it in your root folder now. | Closure text: I confirmed the root cause locally: unauthenticated GitHub API calls are hitting HTTP 403 rate limit exceeded. I’m patching the Python bridge to automatically fall back to the GitHub web release endpoint when API is rate-limited, plus better network fallback/logging.

- L6610 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6815 (score=2) | Issue: Issue: settings.js:78-100 has no migration path when new settings are added. | Closure text: I found likely root cause for settings reset: EXE runs from a changing temp extraction path, so browser localStorage origin can change between boots. I’m adding persistent host-side settings storage in the Python launcher and wiring JS to read/write it, and I’ll re-enable debug panel for desktop builds.
- L6614 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16786 (score=3) | Issue: Issue: debug.js:1-50 and main.js:20-30 always initialize debug panel, security/performance issue. | Closure text: Root cause found: the debug log area uses a fixed height: calc(100% - 58px) even though extra rows were added above it, so the log overflows under the panel border. I’m switching the panel to a flex column layout so the log area always fits exactly.
- L6618 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L12113 (score=2) | Issue: Issue: All code exposes window.Platformer global, not encapsulated, collision risk. | Closure text: Platformer.Debug.warn("GameScene.collision", `Resolved embedded player (${context}).`);
- L6622 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6679 (score=2) | Issue: Issue: release.yml uses loose version pins (6.19.0), can break future builds. | Closure text: I’ve patched startup rollback activation. Next I’m adding build-time release note generation and asset/backup cleanup scripts, then wiring them into CI and local builds.

I’m patching the Python bridge to automatically fall back to the GitHub web release endpoint when API is rate-limited, plus better network fallback/logging.
- L6638 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L12406 (score=2) | Issue: Issue: desktop_launcher.py:250-280 creates .bak but never auto-restores if new EXE fails to start. | Closure text: As you can see, the character kinda floats above the ground now, the fasing into the ground issue has been resolved so good job on that. Also when you walk against a wall, it start flickering and jittering, fix this
- L6642 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L6815 (score=2) | Issue: Issue: settings.js:107-140 stores full state in localStorage forever, bloat over time. | Closure text: I found likely root cause for settings reset: EXE runs from a changing temp extraction path, so browser localStorage origin can change between boots. I’m adding persistent host-side settings storage in the Python launcher and wiring JS to read/write it, and I’ll re-enable debug panel for desktop builds.
- L6646 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14065 (score=2) | Issue: Issue: write_build_info.py:1-30 creates build-info.js but game doesn't validate it exists or is valid. | Closure text: This confirms root cause: updater handoff starts, but the game process doesn’t fully terminate, so helper never completes.
- L6647 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17331 (score=2) | Issue: Fix: Add pre-game check: if BUILD_VERSION undefined, show error screen instead of silently failing. | Closure text: I’ve confirmed the root cause path: when ldtk-test is missing in cache, level 5 can silently fall all the way back to the old builder map. I’m now adding a dedicated level-5 built-in fallback and a targeted preload guard so testers always get level 5 data instead of classic fallback, then I’ll build and release.
- L6658 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17240 (score=2) | Issue: Issue: Game crashes if any asset missing, no fallback placeholder. | Closure text: I’m going straight at this specific LDtk fallback issue, trace the exact loader path in GameScene, patch only that root cause, then build and push a new release so testers can verify. I’ll keep every other system untouched.
- L6662 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14065 (score=2) | Issue: Issue: updater.js:129-150 shows offline message once, never retries even after reconnect. | Closure text: This confirms root cause: updater handoff starts, but the game process doesn’t fully terminate, so helper never completes.
- L6685 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14875 (score=4) | Issue: I’m also removing the last updater fallback path so updates use a single source/flow only (GitHub Releases via the desktop bridge), with explicit clean failure messages instead of cascading behavior. | Closure text: Build is done locally (2026.02.16.1338), but GitHub publish from this machine is blocked right now because no GH_TOKEN is set. I’m now preparing a minimal commit (just updater-log path change) and pushing to trigger your GitHub Actions “shadow update” flow instead.
- L6705 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15552 (score=2) | Issue: Build info validation: hard fail with clear error if build metadata missing (main.js). | Closure text: Clear root cause now: killing the old PID is terminating the helper before it can continue. I’m removing PID-kill/wait from the helper entirely and relying on copy-retry lock release (which is safer and already implemented). Then I’ll build, push, and tag a higher version again.
- L6707 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17013 (score=3) | Issue: Missing asset degradation: optional asset warnings/fallback path preserved; criticals now validated pre-build (boot-scene.js, validate_assets.py). | Closure text: I confirmed the root cause and validated the fallback path in code. I’m now rebuilding your local EXE so this fix is live in the desktop app immediately.
- L6789 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7744 (score=2) | Issue: Note: the final line ERROR: Input redirection is not supported came from the batch pause in this non-interactive run, after build completion. The install itself succeeded. | Closure text: If level-selection still misbehaves, send one screenshot + one new error block (if any), and I’ll do the final lock (fixed map viewport + letterbox only in WorldMap scene).
- L6821 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7081 (score=2) | Issue: I see one remaining issue: main.js still wasn’t actually awaiting host settings bootstrap. I’m applying that exact fix now and rebuilding once more. | Closure text: Patched. I’m rebuilding now; after this, opening Options from main menu will keep the menu scene alive and animated underneath.
- L6881 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L18329 (score=2) | Issue: Still no save after reboot, check if all the files are present to make this work | Closure text: Rebuild finished and the fallback logic is now inside the shipped bundle. I’m doing a final check of changed files so you know exactly what was updated.
- L6883 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17240 (score=3) | Issue: I’m going to verify the full persistence chain end-to-end (JS save call, desktop bridge methods, and actual settings file content/timestamps), then patch whatever is missing. | Closure text: I’m going straight at this specific LDtk fallback issue, trace the exact loader path in GameScene, patch only that root cause, then build and push a new release so testers can verify. I’ll keep every other system untouched.
- L6960 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7241 (score=2) | Issue: If it still resets, send the two latest lines containing Settings.host from runtime-debug.log. | Closure text: Good catch. I’ll remove the sticky overlay behavior and make the footer a fixed non-overlapping row under a dedicated scroll area, so the scrollbar and last settings lines stay fully visible. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L7046 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7052 (score=3) | Issue: When going to options and returning to main menu, the character jumping around resets at the most left side of the screen, make sure the the character doesn't reset when returning to main menu. Also, in options, the background should be the same as main menu, but transparant | Closure text: I’ve patched both scenes. I’m rebuilding now so you can verify: runner state should persist across Options->Menu, and Options now uses a transparent menu-style animated background.
- L7126 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7128 (score=4) | Issue: I see the issue: the Options DOM panel is not being re-laid out on resize, and the menu UI is still visible behind it. I’m fixing both by adding a real resize layout handler for Options and hiding menu UI while Options overlay is open. | Closure text: I’ve patched the resize/layout path and menu-overlay visibility. I’m rebuilding now; this should keep Options centered and prevent the menu buttons from showing through.
- L7171 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7706 (score=2) | Issue: If it still reproduces on your side, send one fresh screenshot from: | Closure text: If it still fails, send one screenshot from 1646 and I’ll lock this by disabling world-map scaling entirely and using fixed map pixels + letterbox (guaranteed stable).
- L7234 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8992 (score=4) | Issue: If scroll still fails, I’ll switch to native Phaser-only options widgets (no DOM), which avoids webview scroll conflicts entirely. | Closure text: I see it clearly: Options scene is active (title/back render), but the HTML options panel isn’t being painted. I’m removing the fragile overlay DOM path: Options will open as its own scene and mount the settings panel directly to document.body (fixed overlay), which avoids this Phaser DOM layering bug entirely. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L7280 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15236 (score=3) | Issue: Great, main menu looks clean and dont know any other updates. Update it to git, make sure updating still works in main game and also make sure to note every new element added in whats changed since last git push | Closure text: Untill this problem is fixed, always push to git to test if update feature works aftr updated local exe
- L7282 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15238 (score=4) | Issue: I’ll do this in three steps: verify updater paths still intact, prepare a commit with a complete “what changed” summary, then push to origin so your in-game update pipeline can pick it up. I’m checking git/workflow state first. | Closure text: Understood. I’ll use this workflow until fixed: every local updater change gets pushed to main and a new shadow release tag so in-game update can be tested immediately. I’m doing that now for the latest updater fix.
- L7302 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15258 (score=3) | Issue: Main menu “What’s Changed” fallback now includes all newly added elements since last push, so users still see meaningful notes even if remote release notes are unavailable. | Closure text: Main push is now done. I’m tagging a new shadow release version so the updater can detect it in-game.
- L7311 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14875 (score=4) | Issue: You’re right, that panel is still showing the latest public release notes instead of your installed local build (1537). I’m patching it so when GitHub notes are older than your current build, it shows local current-build notes instead. | Closure text: Build is done locally (2026.02.16.1338), but GitHub publish from this machine is blocked right now because no GH_TOKEN is set. I’m now preparing a minimal commit (just updater-log path change) and pushing to trigger your GitHub Actions “shadow update” flow instead.
- L7315 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L13681 (score=3) | Issue: Exactly. In 1537, it was still showing the last public release (1438) because GitHub release notes were older than your local build. | Closure text: Done. I used GitHub Actions flow and triggered a new release build for updater testing.
- L7447 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7591 (score=2) | Issue: New WorldMapScene (top-down, fixed camera, smooth movement, blocked-region collisions, node graph with 5 nodes). | Closure text: I found the root cause: the world map is drawn in a large fixed world space, but resize can make the visible viewport crop/offset that space. I’m fixing it by fitting the map to the camera on every resize and pinning all map UI with scrollFactor(0) so it stays correctly anchored.
- L7534 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7544 (score=2) | Issue: If it still shows old behavior, fully close any running AnimePlatformer.exe and launch this exact file: | Closure text: I’ve patched the runtime and launcher; next I’m rebuilding and replacing your local AnimePlatformer.exe so you can verify resize behavior immediately.
- L7566 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7706 (score=3) | Issue: If it still drifts, send one screenshot plus the last 20 ResizeSync lines from debug and I’ll lock it down further. | Closure text: If it still fails, send one screenshot from 1646 and I’ll lock this by disabling world-map scaling entirely and using fixed map pixels + letterbox (guaranteed stable).
- L7604 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7636 (score=2) | Issue: If anything still shifts, send one screenshot of the bad state and I’ll adjust the camera fit padding values next. | Closure text: Root cause was exactly what your screenshot showed: map camera zoom + world-space background caused exposed clear-color margins in level selection.
- L7619 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8831 (score=2) | Issue: still re-fits immediately + delayed after resize/fullscreen | Closure text: Launcher patch is done. I’m rebuilding now so your local EXE immediately starts native fullscreen on boot.
- L7624 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7636 (score=3) | Issue: Please test Level Selection again with resize/fullscreen. If it still misaligns, send a fresh screenshot from 1636 and I’ll tune the fit bounds from actual rendered text metrics per frame. | Closure text: Root cause was exactly what your screenshot showed: map camera zoom + world-space background caused exposed clear-color margins in level selection.
- L7630 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7636 (score=3) | Issue: The issue is clear now: on the world map, camera zoom-out exposes area outside the map background, so you see the light-blue engine clear color. I’m fixing this by pinning the world-map backdrop to screen space (scrollFactor(0)) so it always fills the viewport during resize/zoom. | Closure text: Root cause was exactly what your screenshot showed: map camera zoom + world-space background caused exposed clear-color margins in level selection.
- L7651 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9036 (score=4) | Issue: I’m going to pinpoint this with the actual resize math now. I suspect level-selection is still using a stale/internal viewport size (or resolution-scale mismatch), so I’ll patch WorldMap to use explicit viewport values from the resize event and clamp everything to that source of truth. | Closure text: I’m targeting the root cause as viewport mismatch on first boot: UI DOM is likely being positioned using stale Phaser sizes until an ESC-triggered relayout. I’m patching Options to use real window viewport (innerWidth/innerHeight) for DOM layout and adding an initial forced relayout pulse at startup.
- L7653 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9036 (score=4) | Issue: I found a likely culprit in the world-map-only code: I’m explicitly overriding camera viewport there, which can desync from the real resized canvas. I’m removing that override and letting Phaser keep the full viewport, while still keeping zoom/centering logic. | Closure text: I’m targeting the root cause as viewport mismatch on first boot: UI DOM is likely being positioned using stale Phaser sizes until an ESC-triggered relayout. I’m patching Options to use real window viewport (innerWidth/innerHeight) for DOM layout and adding an initial forced relayout pulse at startup.
- L7669 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L12276 (score=3) | Issue: I’m switching level selection to a resize-proof transform: map content (nodes/paths/avatar/blocked zones) will scale as one container to fit the viewport, instead of relying on camera zoom math. This avoids the recurring world-map-only resize drift. | Closure text: That INSIDE_TILE log confirms the previous build had a micro body (1.5x2.5) from scale math. I’ve now fixed sizing in world-space, and I’m applying one more strict fix: body offset will also be scale-correct (world->raw conversion), so feet alignment can’t drift into the ground. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L7685 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7744 (score=3) | Issue: Please test once more; if it still breaks, send one screenshot from 1644 and I’ll patch only that exact remaining artifact. | Closure text: If level-selection still misbehaves, send one screenshot + one new error block (if any), and I’ll do the final lock (fixed map viewport + letterbox only in WorldMap scene).
- L7706 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7744 (score=5) | Issue: If it still fails, send one screenshot from 1646 and I’ll lock this by disabling world-map scaling entirely and using fixed map pixels + letterbox (guaranteed stable). | Closure text: If level-selection still misbehaves, send one screenshot + one new error block (if any), and I’ll do the final lock (fixed map viewport + letterbox only in WorldMap scene).
- L7727 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7767 (score=3) | Issue: Perfect, this error gives the exact fault line. I’m fixing two things now: adding null-safe guards in MenuScene.layoutMenu and removing the risky forced scene resize emit from the global resize sync that can hit scenes mid-transition. Then I’ll rebuild locally. | Closure text: I’ve patched the crash path. I’ll rebuild/install locally now so you can retest the exact failing sequence immediately.
- L7729 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L7769 (score=3) | Issue: Good catch. I fixed the crash path from your stack trace and installed a new local build. | Closure text: Crash fixed from your latest report and installed locally.

I’m removing the fragile overlay DOM path: Options will open as its own scene and mount the settings panel directly to document.body (fixed overlay), which avoids this Phaser DOM layering bug entirely. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L7765 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8992 (score=3) | Issue: Great, this pinpoints it exactly: resize is hitting MenuScene.layoutMenu during teardown, where Phaser objects still exist as refs but are internally destroyed. I’m making layoutMenu fully destruction-safe (guard each object + try/catch) and gating resize callbacks by scene active state. | Closure text: I see it clearly: Options scene is active (title/back render), but the HTML options panel isn’t being painted. I’m removing the fragile overlay DOM path: Options will open as its own scene and mount the settings panel directly to document.body (fixed overlay), which avoids this Phaser DOM layering bug entirely.

If it still happens, send the next COPY_THIS_TO_ASSISTANT block and I’ll patch that precise call site immediately. | Closure text: I’ve patched bundle order to include the new manager. Next I’m adding the tutorial-world JSON structure and docs, then wiring a warm-load call in BootScene.
- L7801 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9144 (score=2) | Issue: Patched from your exact crash report and installed locally. | Closure text: Patched and rebuilt locally.
- L7810 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L12276 (score=2) | Issue: Run this build and retry the previous resize sequence. If any crash remains, send the next error block and I’ll continue at that exact callsite. | Closure text: That INSIDE_TILE log confirms the previous build had a micro body (1.5x2.5) from scale math. I’ve now fixed sizing in world-space, and I’m applying one more strict fix: body offset will also be scale-correct (world->raw conversion), so feet alignment can’t drift into the ground. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L7815 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L10869 (score=4) | Issue: I’ll keep menu BGM alive when entering level selection by removing the forced stop on Play -> WorldMap, while still letting game music take over only when an actual level starts. I’m patching and rebuilding locally now. | Closure text: Native LDtk rendering is patched in. I’m rebuilding locally now; then level 5 should draw your actual Cavernas tiles from test.ldtk directly.

- L8089 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L13556 (score=2) | Issue: Menu -> Play -> existing world-map behavior still appears (no render migration yet). | Closure text: Done. I baked the hitbox into global defaults so everyone gets the same profile on first install, and I added a one-time migration so existing installs align too.
- L8131 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17782 (score=5) | Issue: Added robust fallback using embedded tutorial-world data if JSON fetch fails. | Closure text: Ran rg -n "menu-bgm loaderror|Failed to create menu-bgm sound instance|Missing cached ldtk-test JSON; using Level 5 fallback data \(JSON/built-in\)|Resolved embedded player \(spawn\)|menu-bgm not found in cache" js/scenes/*.js

I’ll keep every other system untouched.
- L8166 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16078 (score=3) | Issue: Received. I’m pausing sprint progression and validating why your runtime still shows old map. I’ll check the built bundle/exe path and then rebuild/install locally so the new world-map renderer is actually in the executable you’re launching. | Closure text: I found the menu source; next I’ll patch menu-scene.js and rebuild app.bundle.js so the label appears in the shipped runtime.
- L8315 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17331 (score=3) | Issue: I’ll harden the world-map renderer with explicit error logging and switch path rendering from Graphics to concrete Line objects so missing links can’t silently fail. Then I’ll rebuild the EXE locally. | Closure text: I’ve confirmed the root cause path: when ldtk-test is missing in cache, level 5 can silently fall all the way back to the old builder map. I’m now adding a dedicated level-5 built-in fallback and a targeted preload guard so testers always get level 5 data instead of classic fallback, then I’ll build and release.
- L8331 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15917 (score=2) | Issue: Please run and, if lines still do not appear, copy the debug console lines containing: | Closure text: I’ve identified a likely root cause: PyInstaller restart can inherit stale _MEIPASS2/_PYI_* environment from the updater chain, which can trigger exactly this python313.dll load failure. I’m patching the helper to scrub those env vars before relaunch, and also silencing console echo so that black cmd window won’t appear.

I’m building and pushing this as a new test release (1520) now so you can verify the Python DLL error is gone after update/relaunch.
- L8488 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15238 (score=3) | Issue: I’m checking the current audio flow and debug logger hooks in the latest files, then I’ll patch missing music start points and add explicit log lines for every music state change/failure so you can see exactly why audio is silent. | Closure text: Understood. I’ll use this workflow until fixed: every local updater change gets pushed to main and a new shadow release tag so in-game update can be tested immediately. I’m doing that now for the latest updater fix.
- L8490 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8994 (score=3) | Issue: I found likely regressions in WorldMapScene audio ownership. I’m reading that scene now and will patch it so map/menu BGM always resumes on map entry, and logs every start/stop/failure path. | Closure text: I replaced the Options overlay DOM path with a fixed body-mounted panel and switched menu -> options to dedicated scene mode. Rebuilding now.
- L8492 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8494 (score=5) | Issue: I’m adding explicit audio diagnostics in both MenuScene and WorldMapScene: volume/mute context logs, resume attempts, play retry hooks, and warnings when playback is blocked or effectively muted. Then I’ll rebuild locally so you can test immediately. | Closure text: I’ve patched audio startup diagnostics and retry logic in menu/world map. I’m rebuilding the bundle and local EXE now so you can test immediately without pulling from Git.
- L8513 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15413 (score=2) | Issue: logs when load fails and fallback is used | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: the helper is hanging in the tasklist | find check, and your visible CMD window suggests fallback launch path is being used. I’m removing that fragile PID-check loop and switching to a direct forced-kill handoff, plus tightening helper launch flags to avoid the visible console.
- L8528 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L12189 (score=2) | Issue: The autowalk when you first enter the level selection doesn't need to be there, only let the player decide when to move | Closure text: Perfect, this log gave the root cause: your player body is only 1.5x2.5, so collision is effectively broken and she sinks. I’m fixing body sizing to be world-size aware (independent of sprite scale) and rebuilding now.
- L8567 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16786 (score=2) | Issue: Added debug logs for blocked movement | Closure text: Root cause found: the debug log area uses a fixed height: calc(100% - 58px) even though extra rows were added above it, so the log overflows under the panel border. I’m switching the panel to a flex column layout so the log area always fits exactly.
- L8615 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9487 (score=2) | Issue: While shop is open, movement is blocked and input is consumed by shop UI | Closure text: I found the root cause: movement still used acceleration/drag and then reapplied drag every frame, which reintroduced glide. I’m replacing horizontal movement with direct per-frame velocity (digital input) so there is zero slide.
- L8686 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17331 (score=3) | Issue: If missing assets, should show fallback warning instead of crashing. | Closure text: I’ve confirmed the root cause path: when ldtk-test is missing in cache, level 5 can silently fall all the way back to the old builder map. I’m now adding a dedicated level-5 built-in fallback and a targeted preload guard so testers always get level 5 data instead of classic fallback, then I’ll build and release.

Rebuilding now.
- L8882 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8992 (score=3) | Issue: I’m patching this as a failure-recovery issue: if Options fails on first open, Menu UI is left hidden. I’ll add hard error recovery + explicit debug logging so errors always surface in the debug console, then rebuild. | Closure text: I see it clearly: Options scene is active (title/back render), but the HTML options panel isn’t being painted. I’m removing the fragile overlay DOM path: Options will open as its own scene and mount the settings panel directly to document.body (fixed overlay), which avoids this Phaser DOM layering bug entirely. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L8884 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15965 (score=3) | Issue: I added crash-safe handling for Options and forced error logging into debug console. Rebuilding now to verify no syntax/runtime regressions. | Closure text: I patched the restart environment scrub and removed remaining console echo. I’m building and pushing this as a new test release (1520) now so you can verify the Python DLL error is gone after update/relaunch.
- L8886 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8994 (score=4) | Issue: I added recovery + hard logging for Options initialization failures. I’m rebuilding now so the debug panel can capture the actual error instead of leaving a blank overlay. | Closure text: I replaced the Options overlay DOM path with a fixed body-mounted panel and switched menu -> options to dedicated scene mode. Rebuilding now.
- L8896 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8994 (score=3) | Issue: Scene auto-cleans up and returns to menu so you never get stuck on empty overlay. | Closure text: I replaced the Options overlay DOM path with a fixed body-mounted panel and switched menu -> options to dedicated scene mode. Rebuilding now.
- L8903 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8992 (score=2) | Issue: If it fails, debug panel should now show a concrete error line (OptionsScene.create / MenuScene.options) instead of blank screen with no trace. | Closure text: I see it clearly: Options scene is active (title/back render), but the HTML options panel isn’t being painted. I’m removing the fragile overlay DOM path: Options will open as its own scene and mount the settings panel directly to document.body (fixed overlay), which avoids this Phaser DOM layering bug entirely. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L8905 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17240 (score=2) | Issue: If it still blanks, send the new === COPY_THIS_TO_ASSISTANT === block and I’ll patch the exact failing statement immediately. | Closure text: I’m going straight at this specific LDtk fallback issue, trace the exact loader path in GameScene, patch only that root cause, then build and push a new release so testers can verify. I’ll keep every other system untouched.
- L8934 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16786 (score=3) | Issue: If first-click still fails, the debug log should now always contain MenuScene.options or OptionsScene.create with the exact cause. Send that block and I’ll patch that line directly. | Closure text: Root cause found: the debug log area uses a fixed height: calc(100% - 58px) even though extra rows were added above it, so the log overflows under the panel border. I’m switching the panel to a flex column layout so the log area always fits exactly.
- L8937 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8992 (score=3) | Issue: These logs confirm Options initializes successfully; this is now a render-order/visibility issue, not a crash. I’ll force Options scene + DOM to top/visible after first frame and add a visibility self-check log, then rebuild. | Closure text: I see it clearly: Options scene is active (title/back render), but the HTML options panel isn’t being painted. I’m removing the fragile overlay DOM path: Options will open as its own scene and mount the settings panel directly to document.body (fixed overlay), which avoids this Phaser DOM layering bug entirely. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L8964 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8994 (score=2) | Issue: Still not working, debug menu with boot doesn't show, when clicking options and returning to main menu, options doesn't show | Closure text: I replaced the Options overlay DOM path with a fixed body-mounted panel and switched menu -> options to dedicated scene mode. Rebuilding now.
- L8966 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L8992 (score=4) | Issue: I’m going to harden this with a simpler flow: open Options by scene.start (not overlay launch), guarantee debug toggle is always visible at boot, and add explicit logs for every scene transition so we can trace exactly where it fails. | Closure text: I see it clearly: Options scene is active (title/back render), but the HTML options panel isn’t being painted. I’m removing the fragile overlay DOM path: Options will open as its own scene and mount the settings panel directly to document.body (fixed overlay), which avoids this Phaser DOM layering bug entirely. Then I’ll rebuild.
- L9014 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9036 (score=3) | Issue: Got it. That means first-render timing is still flaky. I’m adding a hard “first-frame DOM recovery” in Options: it will re-mount/reposition/force-visible for the first second, so it shows immediately without needing ESC or any interaction. Then I’ll rebuild locally. | Closure text: I’m targeting the root cause as viewport mismatch on first boot: UI DOM is likely being positioned using stale Phaser sizes until an ESC-triggered relayout. I’m patching Options to use real window viewport (innerWidth/innerHeight) for DOM layout and adding an initial forced relayout pulse at startup.
- L9049 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17240 (score=3) | Issue: This should remove the “only appears after ESC” issue. If not, send one more screenshot plus the single OptionsScene.dom line from debug; with that line I can hard-lock exact coordinates for your monitor profile. | Closure text: I’m going straight at this specific LDtk fallback issue, trace the exact loader path in GameScene, patch only that root cause, then build and push a new release so testers can verify. I’ll keep every other system untouched.

- L9077 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9513 (score=3) | Issue: Found and fixed the likely root problem. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: activation currently waits for !jumpHeld (all jump keys up), so if one jump key is still held, jetpack never fires. I’m switching to explicit release detection (JustUp) and adding a small activation impulse boost + stronger diagnostics.
- L9136 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14875 (score=2) | Issue: Great error report. I’ll patch this as an async-after-destroy bug in MenuScene update status text, add lifecycle guards around those async update callbacks, then rebuild locally. | Closure text: Build is done locally (2026.02.16.1338), but GitHub publish from this machine is blocked right now because no GH_TOKEN is set. I’m now preparing a minimal commit (just updater-log path change) and pushing to trigger your GitHub Actions “shadow update” flow instead.
- L9138 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17019 (score=3) | Issue: I found the exact crash point: async updater callback is trying to write text after the Menu scene/text texture is gone. I’m adding scene/object liveness guards and safe text setters around all update status writes. | Closure text: Root cause found: your updater was hitting GitHub API rate limits (HTTP 403 rate limit exceeded), and the bridge returned generic Can't reach update server.
- L9140 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14875 (score=3) | Issue: I’m fixing the crash from your pasted stack now. I’ll patch the bottom-left update text flow so async update checks cannot write to destroyed Phaser text objects, then rebuild locally and give you the new EXE. | Closure text: Build is done locally (2026.02.16.1338), but GitHub publish from this machine is blocked right now because no GH_TOKEN is set. I’m now preparing a minimal commit (just updater-log path change) and pushing to trigger your GitHub Actions “shadow update” flow instead.
- L9142 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9513 (score=3) | Issue: I found the update-status text path already partially guarded, but I’m adding a stronger fallback now: automatic text-object rebuild on failure so the WebGL text canvas null case cannot crash during async update checks. Then I’ll rebuild the EXE. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: activation currently waits for !jumpHeld (all jump keys up), so if one jump key is still held, jetpack never fires. I’m switching to explicit release detection (JustUp) and adding a small activation impulse boost + stronger diagnostics.
- L9148 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15238 (score=2) | Issue: Hardened MenuScene bottom-left update text updates so async updater callbacks cannot call setText on stale/destroyed Phaser text objects. | Closure text: Understood. I’ll use this workflow until fixed: every local updater change gets pushed to main and a new shadow release tag so in-game update can be tested immediately. I’m doing that now for the latest updater fix.
- L9169 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9487 (score=2) | Issue: I found the Credits logic embedded in MenuScene. I’m replacing that button and flow with a dedicated ExtrasScene, then wiring navigation arrays so keyboard/menu interaction still works. | Closure text: I found the root cause: movement still used acceleration/drag and then reapplied drag every frame, which reintroduced glide. I’m replacing horizontal movement with direct per-frame velocity (digital input) so there is zero slide.
- L9309 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9399 (score=7) | Issue: Space doesn't activate jetpack, also make it like double jumping, the double jump activates the jetpack | Closure text: When you're done doing this, make sure the jetpack only activates with a (simular to) double jumping, so at the double jump, activate the jetpack

- L9315 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9513 (score=4) | Issue: I’m implementing a true “double-jump to jetpack” trigger now: second jump press in air starts jetpack boost, and both SPACE and W/UP can sustain thrust while airborne. I’m also adding a short forced burst so a tap still works reliably. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: activation currently waits for !jumpHeld (all jump keys up), so if one jump key is still held, jetpack never fires. I’m switching to explicit release detection (JustUp) and adding a small activation impulse boost + stronger diagnostics.
- L9327 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9481 (score=2) | Issue: Added a short guaranteed jetpack burst on activation (~180ms) so a quick second tap still triggers reliably. | Closure text: Jetpack hold-release activation and minimum active period are patched in. I’m rebuilding the EXE now.
- L9456 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9487 (score=3) | Issue: If you still feel any slide, I can make ground conflict stop 100% immediate every frame regardless of physics timestep (ultra-snappy mode). | Closure text: I found the root cause: movement still used acceleration/drag and then reapplied drag every frame, which reintroduced glide. I’m replacing horizontal movement with direct per-frame velocity (digital input) so there is zero slide.
- L9487 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15413 (score=5) | Issue: I found the root cause: movement still used acceleration/drag and then reapplied drag every frame, which reintroduced glide. I’m replacing horizontal movement with direct per-frame velocity (digital input) so there is zero slide. | Closure text: I found the likely root cause: the helper is hanging in the tasklist | find check, and your visible CMD window suggests fallback launch path is being used.

- L9513 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9515 (score=8) | Issue: I found the likely root cause: activation currently waits for !jumpHeld (all jump keys up), so if one jump key is still held, jetpack never fires. I’m switching to explicit release detection (JustUp) and adding a small activation impulse boost + stronger diagnostics. | Closure text: Root cause found and fixed: jetpack activation depended on !jumpHeld (all jump keys released), so if one key stayed down for a frame, activation silently failed. That made it feel random.
- L9525 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L16786 (score=2) | Issue: Added additional debug warnings for blocked jetpack cases (fuel empty / dash blocking). | Closure text: Root cause found: the debug log area uses a fixed height: calc(100% - 58px) even though extra rows were added above it, so the log overflows under the panel border. I’m switching the panel to a flex column layout so the log area always fits exactly.
- L9549 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9851 (score=2) | Issue: - Jetpack can only activate after the player has left the ground (no boosting from standing still). | Closure text: on jetpack start, if player is already moving up, cap becomes based on current upward velocity instead of fixed low cap.
- L9602 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17240 (score=3) | Issue: I’ve identified the current root issue area in GameScene.update. Next I’m extracting all jetpack logic into a dedicated module and wiring it through one integration point to avoid future regressions. | Closure text: I’m going straight at this specific LDtk fallback issue, trace the exact loader path in GameScene, patch only that root cause, then build and push a new release so testers can verify. I’ll keep every other system untouched.
- L9659 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L12406 (score=2) | Issue: Edge cases: auto-off on landing, blocked at 0 fuel, guarded against ladder/water/wall states. | Closure text: As you can see, the character kinda floats above the ground now, the fasing into the ground issue has been resolved so good job on that. Also when you walk against a wall, it start flickering and jittering, fix this
- L9737 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9836 (score=3) | Issue: I’ve confirmed the module currently still does a startup velocity kick, which causes the rocket-like snap. I’m replacing that with a pure acceleration-based anti-gravity ramp (with brake/lift phases and smooth release) and updating the jetpack tuning config keys accordingly. | Closure text: I found the root cause: we were clamping upward speed to a low fixed cap, which can kill existing jump momentum on jetpack start. I’m adding a momentum-preserving dynamic cap (+small activation kick) so mid-air activation boosts higher instead of flattening first.
- L9832 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L9845 (score=3) | Issue: The only thing missing right now is when the player has vertical velocity and activating the jetpack, it should boost them higher, not slowly go down and let the jetpack push m further. | Closure text: The jetpack had a fixed low upward cap, so activating during upward motion could flatten vertical momentum.
- L10059 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17331 (score=2) | Issue: This file is usable, but it currently contains only one IntGrid layer and no entities. I’ll quickly inspect tile source paths and IntGrid data so I can tell you exactly what works and what’s missing for gameplay import. | Closure text: I’ve confirmed the root cause path: when ldtk-test is missing in cache, level 5 can silently fall all the way back to the old builder map. I’m now adding a dedicated level-5 built-in fallback and a targeted preload guard so testers always get level 5 data instead of classic fallback, then I’ll build and release.
- L10095 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L10101 (score=4) | Issue: I found the current mapping still points Rooftop Start to gameLevel: 1. Next I’m patching level preload/cache to include the LDtk-converted file as level-5, then remap Rooftop Start to level 5. | Closure text: Done. Entering Rooftop Start now loads your LDtk-converted level.
- L10122 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L14875 (score=2) | Issue: You’re right to call it out. I’m checking the runtime path now to confirm whether gameLevel: 5 is actually used or if the loader is still hardcoded to levels 1–4. | Closure text: Build is done locally (2026.02.16.1338), but GitHub publish from this machine is blocked right now because no GH_TOKEN is set. I’m now preparing a minimal commit (just updater-log path change) and pushing to trigger your GitHub Actions “shadow update” flow instead.
- L10133 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L10147 (score=5) | Issue: I found the issue: there are multiple world-map data sources, and one still points Rooftop Start to level 1. I’m fixing that source too, then rebuilding so it definitely takes effect. | Closure text: Root cause found: world-map level resolution was deriving Level_01 -> 1 from the string, so changing Level_01.json alone didn’t affect launch. I’m now setting explicit gameLevel: 5 on the Rooftop map nodes (including embedded fallback) and rebuilding.
- L10447 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L10869 (score=2) | Issue: You’re still not getting 1:1 because the new test.ldtk is still 8px grid. | Closure text: Native LDtk rendering is patched in. I’m rebuilding locally now; then level 5 should draw your actual Cavernas tiles from test.ldtk directly.
- L10464 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L15552 (score=2) | Issue: If you want, I can now add a runtime validator that hard-fails with a clear debug error when LDtk grid isn’t 32, so this can’t silently happen again. | Closure text: Clear root cause now: killing the old PID is terminating the helper before it can continue. I’m removing PID-kill/wait from the helper entirely and relying on copy-retry lock release (which is safer and already implemented). Then I’ll build, push, and tag a higher version again.

I’ll keep fallback to existing JSON if anything fails and log errors to debug. | Closure text: Native LDtk rendering is patched in. I’m rebuilding locally now; then level 5 should draw your actual Cavernas tiles from test.ldtk directly.

Cause is clear: LDtk tiles are rendered, but the old physics ground sprites are still being drawn on top, hiding part of the LDtk art. I’m making collision tiles invisible for LDtk levels so only LDtk visuals are shown. | Closure text: I found the likely cause: tiny-grid body sizing/offset and spawn overlap weren’t strict enough for 8px collision tiles.

- L11439 | Status: `Likely resolved` | Closure: L17331 (score=3) | Issue: I’ve isolated the two root causes: tiny-grid still uses the large glow flame texture path, and camera/movement quantization is making movement look jittery at high zoom. I’m patching both now (tiny dedicated flame + smoother tiny follow/motion). | Closure text: I’ve confirmed the root cause path: when ldtk-test is missing in cache, level 5 can silently fall all the way back to the old builder map. I’m now adding a dedicated level-5 built-in fallback and a targeted preload guard so testers always get level 5 data instead of classic fallback, then I’ll build and release.
