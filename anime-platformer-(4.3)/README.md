# AnimePlatformer — Abandoned v1 Godot Port

> **Status**: Abandoned on 2026-02-18. This was the first Godot port attempt before the blank-slate rebuild.
> The current active project is in `godot_port/`.

## Why this directory is kept

It contains **usable assets** that the current Godot 4 rebuild will eventually need:

- `assets/sprites/player/IFFY_IDLE.png` — player idle sprite
- `assets/sprites/tileset/Cavernas_by_Adam_Saltsman.png` — tileset
- `assets/audio/music/menu_bgm.mp3`, `game_bgm.mp3`, `pause_bgm.mp3` — music tracks
- `assets/levels/level-1.json` through `level-5.json` — level data (JSON command format)

## Do not develop here

All active development happens in `godot_port/`. This directory is an asset source only.
